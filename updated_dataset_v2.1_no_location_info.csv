According to US news website Axios, the president said in a meeting with top national security and homeland security officials about the threat of hurricanes: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
“They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can’t we do that?”
Quoting unnamed sources who were present at the meeting, Axios report that the response from one official was “We’ll look into this.”
On Sunday, the White House declined to comment on the Axios report. “We don’t comment on private discussions that the president may or may not have had with his national security team,” it said.
His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad Unnamed official
On Monday, from the G7 summit in France, Trump passed comment of his own.
“The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous,” he tweeted. “I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!”
Axios reported that Trump raised the same issue on another occasion with a senior administration official. This conversation was apparently recorded in a 2017 national security council memo which used the term “nuclear” in reference to the conversation.
Axios quoted a senior official who defended Trump’s ability to ask tough questions: “His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad.”
Shortly after Trump came to power National Geographic published an article pointing out how frequently the idea of nuking hurricanes has been raised over the last few decades. “It’s an appealing thought,” it said, “especially when, during hurricane season, we’re annually reminded of the immense destruction wrought by these storms.
“And it’s probably why, every year for the past six decades, government agencies have received missives from concerned citizens, urging preemptive attacks against hurricanes using nuclear weapons.”
In the article, Nuking Hurricane: The Surprising History of a Really Bad Idea, the magazine pointed out that the response from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was: “Needless to say, this is not a good idea.”","['donald', 'trump', 'reportedli', 'suggest', 'occas', 'us', 'militari', 'bomb', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'landfall.\naccord', 'us', 'news', 'websit', 'axios,', 'meet', 'top', 'secur', 'homeland', 'secur', 'offici', 'threat', 'hurricanes:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\n“they', 'start', 'form', 'africa,', 'they’r', 'move', 'atlantic,', 'drop', 'bomb', 'insid', 'eye', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'it.', 'whi', 'can’t', 'that?”\nquot', 'unnam', 'sourc', 'meeting,', 'axio', 'report', 'respons', 'offici', '“we’ll', 'this.”\non', 'sunday,', 'white', 'hous', 'declin', 'comment', 'axio', 'report.', '“we', 'don’t', 'comment', 'privat', 'discuss', 'secur', 'team,”', 'said.\nhi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad', 'unnam', 'official\non', 'monday,', 'g7', 'summit', 'france,', 'trump', 'pass', 'comment', 'own.\n“th', 'stori', 'axio', 'presid', 'trump', 'blow', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'prior', 'reach', 'shore', 'ridiculous,”', 'tweeted.', '“i', 'this.', 'just', 'fake', 'news!”\naxio', 'report', 'trump', 'rais', 'issu', 'occas', 'senior', 'administr', 'official.', 'thi', 'convers', 'record', '2017', 'secur', 'council', 'memo', 'term', '“nuclear”', 'refer', 'conversation.\naxio', 'quot', 'senior', 'offici', 'defend', 'trump’', 'abil', 'tough', 'questions:', '“hi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad.”\nshortli', 'trump', 'power', 'nation', 'geograph', 'publish', 'articl', 'frequent', 'idea', 'nuke', 'hurrican', 'rais', 'decades.', '“it’', 'appeal', 'thought,”', 'said,', '“especi', 'when,', 'hurrican', 'season,', 'we’r', 'annual', 'remind', 'immens', 'destruct', 'wrought', 'storms.\n“and', 'it’', 'why,', 'decades,', 'govern', 'agenc', 'receiv', 'missiv', 'concern', 'citizens,', 'urg', 'preemptiv', 'attack', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapons.”\nin', 'article,', 'nuke', 'hurricane:', 'the', 'surpris', 'histori', 'realli', 'bad', 'idea,', 'magazin', 'respons', 'nation', 'ocean', 'atmospher', 'administr', 'was:', '“needless', 'say,', 'idea.”']",2467,394,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.960626793,0.136557051,0.15327942,0,0,0,0.187226484,0,0,0,0,-0.296230159,0.64047619,23,670,52.222,11th Grade,10.469

The paper’s Fact Checker column said Trump hit the milestone on 9 July, a day on which he delivered 62 such claims.
About half of them came in an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, among them a claim to have “tremendous support” in the African American community and the charge that Barack Obama and Joe Biden spied on Trump’s campaign in 2016.
The Post created its database during Trump’s first 100 days in office. Staff have since gone through every statement the president has made at press conferences and rallies, in TV appearances and on social media.
In those first 100 days, the Post’s factcheckers counted 492 false or misleading claims, at a rate of about five a day. Since then, the factcheckers note: “The tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger.”
“The notion that Trump would exceed 20,000 claims before he finished his term appeared ludicrous when the Fact Checker started this project,” wrote Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer, and factcheckers Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly.
Over the last 14 months, as events have unfolded around the Mueller report, Trump’s impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd, Trump has averaged 23 false or misleading claims a day.
The column notes Trump has expressed nearly 1,200 lies and misleading claims about the pandemic, many of which revolve around America’s testing capacity. Trump often says the US has the best record on testing. Experts say testing has not been on par with the size of its outbreak.
The Post’s Fact Checker staff found that Trump’s most prolific lie is his claim that the US economy is the best it has ever been.
Political scientists generally agree that a strong economy is the most important factor for a president seeking re-election. The president first made the claim that the economy is the best it has ever been in June 2018 and, the Post wrote, “it quickly became one of his favorites”.
But Trump has since “been forced to adapt [the message] for the tough economic times, and doing so has made it even more fantastic. Whereas he used to say it was the best economy in US history, he now often recalls that he achieved ‘the best economy in the history of the world’.”","['donald', 'trump', '20,000', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'office,', 'washington', 'post,', 'identifi', '“tsunami', 'untruths”', 'eman', 'oval', 'office.\nth', 'paper’', 'fact', 'checker', 'column', 'trump', 'hit', 'mileston', '9', 'july,', 'deliv', '62', 'claims.\nabout', 'half', 'interview', 'fox', 'news', 'host', 'sean', 'hannity,', 'claim', '“tremend', 'support”', 'african', 'american', 'commun', 'charg', 'barack', 'obama', 'joe', 'biden', 'spi', 'trump’', 'campaign', '2016.\nthe', 'post', 'creat', 'databas', 'trump’', '100', 'office.', 'staff', 'statement', 'press', 'confer', 'rallies,', 'tv', 'appear', 'social', 'media.\nin', '100', 'days,', 'post’', 'factcheck', 'count', '492', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claims,', 'rate', 'day.', 'sinc', 'then,', 'factcheck', 'note:', '“the', 'tsunami', 'untruth', 'loom', 'larger', 'larger.”\n“th', 'notion', 'trump', 'exceed', '20,000', 'claim', 'finish', 'term', 'appear', 'ludicr', 'fact', 'checker', 'start', 'project,”', 'wrote', 'glenn', 'kessler,', 'editor', 'chief', 'writer,', 'factcheck', 'salvador', 'rizzo', 'meg', 'kelly.\nov', '14', 'months,', 'event', 'unfold', 'mueller', 'report,', 'trump’', 'impeachment,', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'polic', 'kill', 'georg', 'floyd,', 'trump', 'averag', '23', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'day.\nth', 'column', 'note', 'trump', 'express', '1,200', 'lie', 'mislead', 'claim', 'pandemic,', 'revolv', 'america’', 'test', 'capacity.', 'trump', 'us', 'record', 'testing.', 'expert', 'test', 'par', 'size', 'outbreak.\nth', 'post’', 'fact', 'checker', 'staff', 'trump’', 'prolif', 'lie', 'claim', 'us', 'economi', 'been.\npolit', 'scientist', 'agre', 'strong', 'economi', 'factor', 'seek', 're-election.', 'the', 'claim', 'economi', 'june', '2018', 'and,', 'post', 'wrote,', '“it', 'favorites”.\nbut', 'trump', '“been', 'forc', 'adapt', '[the', 'message]', 'tough', 'econom', 'times,', 'fantastic.', 'wherea', 'economi', 'us', 'history,', 'recal', 'achiev', '‘the', 'economi', 'histori', 'world’.”']",2395,400,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034567901,0.411111111,17,626,54.691,11th Grade,11.71

Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century.
Insight into the pressure that was heaped upon Fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, comes from thousands of pages of his communication records obtained by the Washington Post and the BuzzFeed news site, separately, and published on Tuesday.
The emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in the White House coronavirus taskforce serving Trump as the Republican US president.
As Fauci, kept on as a leading Covid adviser to Joe Biden, recently told the Post: “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop.
“I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.”
Among the emails obtained by the Post is one in which he speaks of the “crazy people in this world”, whom Fauci appeared to blame for politicizing the crisis, and who ultimately led to him receiving a full-time security team amid threats from extremist critics.
Others detail his wrangling with White House officials, including an exchange with Marc Short, an aide for the then vice-president, Mike Pence. The context is unclear, but according to the heavily redacted email Short wrote: “You correctly noticed the symptoms but misdiagnosed the root cause.”
“Thanks for the note. Understood,” is Fauci’s reply.
Others show correspondence with counterparts in other countries, such as a reply to George Gao, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention. Gao appeared to be seeking Fauci’s forgiveness for the words “big mistake” that were attributed to him in relation to his American counterpart in an article early on in the crisis about the US not advising the public to wear masks.
“That was [a] journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao wrote.
“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.
US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan , came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and “escaped”.
Among the most revealing emails are those from wealthy or influential correspondents. In one dated 3 April last year, Fauci refers to a conversation with the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, about a “collaborative and hopefully synergistic approach to Covid-19” with Gates’s charitable foundation.
Gates’s foundation director, Emilio Emini, says he is “seriously worried” about the health of Fauci, then 79, given his busy schedule. Fauci thanks Emini for his concern and says: “I will try to engage as much as I can given my current circumstances.”
There are also email exchanges with the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, about the creation of a coronavirus information hub on social media, and one with the actor Morgan Freeman who offers to get Covid-19 messaging out to his 100,000 Twitter followers.
Almost every email from Fauci is unfailingly polite and ends with a simple sign-off: “Tony”. And hidden amid the stacks of weighty correspondence are brief moments of humor, such as a 7 April 2020, exchange with an unidentified recipient, forwarding a link to an online news article headlined: “Cuomo Crush and ‘Fauci Fever – Sexualization of These Men Is a Real Thing on the Internet.”
“It will blow your mind,” Fauci writes. “Our society is really totally nuts.”","['as', 'anthoni', 'fauci,', 'us’', 'lead', 'infecti', 'diseas', 'official,', 'grappl', 'stage', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'spring,', 'pull', 'directions.\ndonald', 'trump’', 'white', 'house,', 'downplay', 'dangers,', 'demand', 'portray', 'outbreak', 'terms;', 'media', 'hungri', 'answers;', 'fauci’', 'email', 'inbox', 'constantli', 'officials,', 'public', 'celebr', 'offer', 'advic', 'seek', 'world’', 'deadliest', 'health', 'crisi', 'century.\ninsight', 'pressur', 'heap', 'fauci,', 'head', 'institut', 'allergi', 'infecti', 'diseases,', 'thousand', 'commun', 'record', 'washington', 'post', 'buzzfe', 'news', 'site,', 'separately,', 'publish', 'tuesday.\nth', 'email', 'offer', 'window', 'chaos,', 'panic', 'confus', 'time,', 'consider', 'difficulti', 'fauci', 'face', 'promin', 'figur', 'white', 'hous', 'coronaviru', 'taskforc', 'serv', 'trump', 'republican', 'us', 'president.\na', 'fauci,', 'lead', 'covid', 'advis', 'joe', 'biden,', 'post:', '“i', 'singl', 'question,', 'bit', 'confus', 'mix', 'messag', 'come', 'white', 'hous', 'what’', 'real', 'scoop.\n“i', 'reput', 'i', 'respond', 'help,', 'take', 'time.', 'and', 'it’', 'consuming,', 'i', 'do.”\namong', 'email', 'post', 'speak', '“crazi', 'world”,', 'fauci', 'appear', 'blame', 'politic', 'crisis,', 'ultim', 'led', 'receiv', 'full-tim', 'secur', 'team', 'amid', 'threat', 'extremist', 'critics.\noth', 'detail', 'wrangl', 'white', 'hous', 'officials,', 'exchang', 'marc', 'short,', 'aid', 'vice-president,', 'mike', 'pence.', 'the', 'context', 'unclear,', 'heavili', 'redact', 'email', 'short', 'wrote:', '“you', 'correctli', 'notic', 'symptom', 'misdiagnos', 'root', 'cause.”\n“thank', 'note.', 'understood,”', 'fauci’', 'reply.\noth', 'correspond', 'counterpart', 'countries,', 'repli', 'georg', 'gao,', 'director', 'chines', 'center', 'diseas', 'control', 'prevention.', 'gao', 'appear', 'seek', 'fauci’', 'forgiv', '“big', 'mistake”', 'attribut', 'relat', 'american', 'counterpart', 'articl', 'crisi', 'us', 'advis', 'public', 'wear', 'masks.\n“that', '[a]', 'journalist’', 'wording.', 'hope', 'understand,”', 'gao', 'wrote.\n“i', 'understand', 'completely.', 'no', 'problem.', 'we', 'together,”', 'fauci', 'replied.\nus-china', 'tension', 'pandem', 'us', 'investig', 'virus,', 'discov', 'wuhan', ',', 'animals,', 'scientif', 'community’', 'posit', 'time,', 'truth', 'theori', 'viru', 'studi', 'laboratori', '“escaped”.\namong', 'reveal', 'email', 'wealthi', 'influenti', 'correspondents.', 'in', 'date', '3', 'april', 'year,', 'fauci', 'refer', 'convers', 'microsoft', 'founder,', 'bill', 'gates,', '“collabor', 'synergist', 'approach', 'covid-19”', 'gates’', 'charit', 'foundation.\ngates’', 'foundat', 'director,', 'emilio', 'emini,', '“serious', 'worried”', 'health', 'fauci,', '79,', 'busi', 'schedule.', 'fauci', 'emini', 'concern', 'says:', '“i', 'engag', 'i', 'current', 'circumstances.”\nther', 'email', 'exchang', 'facebook', 'founder,', 'mark', 'zuckerberg,', 'creation', 'coronaviru', 'hub', 'social', 'media,', 'actor', 'morgan', 'freeman', 'offer', 'covid-19', 'messag', '100,000', 'twitter', 'followers.\nalmost', 'email', 'fauci', 'unfailingli', 'polit', 'simpl', 'sign-off:', '“tony”.', 'and', 'hidden', 'amid', 'stack', 'weighti', 'correspond', 'moment', 'humor,', '7', 'april', '2020,', 'exchang', 'unidentifi', 'recipient,', 'forward', 'link', 'onlin', 'news', 'articl', 'headlined:', '“cuomo', 'crush', '‘fauci', 'fever', '–', 'sexual', 'these', 'men', 'is', 'real', 'thing', 'internet.”\n“it', 'blow', 'mind,”', 'fauci', 'writes.', '“our', 'societi', 'total', 'nuts.”']",4192,668,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014166667,0.249166667,29,1134,44.635,College Level,12.996

A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored, to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”.
During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”.
The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.”
The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.”
He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020.
Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago.
The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”.
The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise.
Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions.
Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia.
Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.”
It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Thursday.
Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.","['former', 'us', 'donald', 'trump', 'appear', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'question', 'lose', '2020', 'election.\na', 'dramat', '30-second', 'advert', 'morgan’', '–', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'featur', 'rupert', 'murdoch’', 'talktv', '–', 'call', 'present', '“dishonest”', '“a', 'fool”.\ndur', 'interview,', 'trump,', '75,', 'appear', 'agit', 'morgan', 'tell', '2020', 'elect', '“free', 'fair”', '“you', 'lost”.\nth', 'responds:', '“onli', 'fool', 'that”.', 'morgan', 'trump', 'fool,', 'replies:', '“i', 'now,', 'yeah.”\nth', '45th', 'appear', 'defens', 'preview,', 'tell', 'morgan:', '“i', 'i’m', 'honest', 'man,', 'honest', 'you,', 'actually.”\nh', 'present', '“i', 'don’t', 'you’r', 'real”', 'morgan', 'fail', 'produc', '“hard', 'evidence”', 'support', 'unfound', 'disprov', 'claim', 'widespread', 'elector', 'fraud', '2020.\ntrump', 'prepar', 'presid', 'lose', 'joe', 'biden', 'ago.\nth', 'advert,', 'promis', '“the', 'explos', 'interview', 'year”,', 'trump', 'appear', 'walk', 'morgan,', 'tell', 'camera', 'crew', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”.\nth', '75-minut', 'screen', 'monday', '8pm,', 'launch', 'murdoch’', 'televis', 'enterprise.\nalthough', 'news', 'uk', 'talktv', 'tradit', 'roll', 'news', 'channel', 'featur', 'entertainment,', 'documentari', 'sport', 'programming,', 'bedrock', 'output', 'current', 'affair', 'discussions.\nmorgan', 'reportedli', 'paid', '£50m', 'host', 'daili', 'talkshow,', 'stream', 'fox', 'nation', 'us', 'air', 'sky', 'news', 'australia.\nspeak', 'hire', 'morgan', 'september,', 'murdoch', 'said:', '“pier', 'broadcast', 'channel', 'afraid', 'hire.', 'pier', 'brilliant', 'presenter,', 'talent', 'journalist', 'think', 'feeling.”\nit', 'morgan', 'announc', 'return', 'itv', 'year,', 'guest', 'lorrain', 'thursday.\nlast', 'left', 'itv', 'breakfast', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'on-air', 'clash', 'weather', 'present', 'alex', 'beresford', 'duke', 'duchess', 'sussex’', 'interview', 'oprah', 'winfrey.']",2346,386,2,0.935979291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.352055061,0,0,0.168859649,0.474122807,16,608,53.125,11th Grade,12.076

A short clip released on Wednesday to promote talkTV, the new Rupert Murdoch-owned TV station, gave the impression that the former US president walked out of an interview with Morgan in anger at the tough line of questioning.
The Murdoch-owned Sun and New York Post tabloids ran front-page news stories on the supposed bust-up as part of a carefully planned global marketing strategy for Morgan’s new show, which launches on Monday.
On tomorrow's front page: Donald Trump stormed out of a world exclusive interview with Piers Morgan in a blazing row
https://t.co/UxFHVIgi5O pic.twitter.com/Fs9CYYaCcs — The Sun (@TheSun) April 20, 2022
Trump’s team claimed the clip was misleadingly edited to give the impression Trump shouted “turn the camera off” while rising from his chair in anger. Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggested that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was subsequently edited for dramatic effect.
Taylor Budowich, Trump’s spokesperson, said: “This is a pathetic attempt to use President Trump as a way to revive the career of a failed television host.”
The mutually dependent relationship between Trump and Morgan has produced multiple interviews over the years, often generating headlines that keep both in the public eye.
The premise of Morgan’s new national show is that the presenter will be a fearless individual who says the things that are now impossible to say on national television. Promotional interviews for Piers Morgan Uncensored, which will earn its host tens of millions of pounds over the course of his contract, have shown him repeatedly complain about “cancel culture” and compare “woke” policies to fascism. Morgan’s personal approach to marketing the programme involves picking fights on Twitter with liberal or leftwing critics in the hope of provoking a reaction.
One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years.
In a surreal twist that shows the extent to which politics and the media are becoming increasingly entwined, it appears the individual responsible for the dossier was the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. He hosts a rival evening show on the rightwing channel GB News and will be competing with Morgan’s show for many of the same viewers.
In a video posted to his YouTube channel, Farage recalled visiting Mar-a-Lago days before the interview took place and telling Trump that Morgan had “gone around boasting in the UK media” that he was his friend while also “stitching you up”.
Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited.
Morgan, who was once sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photos, said: “He says it’s a rigged election, and he now says I have a rigged promo. What I would say is watch the interview. It will all be there. We won’t be doing any duplicitous editing.
“The promo reflects exactly what happened. Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go. But when people see the interview they’ll see that we have nice exchanges. We always have done before. But simmering is this anger he was feeling about what was said to him before we started the interview.”
The presenter quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain last year after refusing to apologise over comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He has said he is not right wing “but a fairly frustrated liberal” who had been a victim of cancel culture.
In the end, the self-described “narcissistically self-promotional” Morgan told the Lorraine show he was delighted with Trump’s furious reaction to the interview, due to the publicity it was creating: “I said to my team, the only way this can get bigger is if I wake up in the morning to a personal statement from Donald J Trump. [At] 5 am my phone rattled, and there it was!”","['donald', 'trump', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan,', 'claim', 'british', 'televis', 'present', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'video', 'meet', 'creat', 'buzz', 'show.\na', 'short', 'clip', 'releas', 'wednesday', 'promot', 'talktv,', 'rupert', 'murdoch-own', 'tv', 'station,', 'impress', 'us', 'walk', 'interview', 'morgan', 'anger', 'tough', 'questioning.\nth', 'murdoch-own', 'sun', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'tabloid', 'front-pag', 'news', 'stori', 'suppos', 'bust-up', 'care', 'plan', 'global', 'market', 'strategi', 'morgan’', 'show,', 'launch', 'monday.\non', ""tomorrow'"", 'front', 'page:', 'donald', 'trump', 'storm', 'exclus', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'blaze', 'row\nhttps://t.co/uxfhvigi5o', 'pic.twitter.com/fs9cyyacc', '—', 'the', 'sun', '(@thesun)', 'april', '20,', '2022\ntrump’', 'team', 'claim', 'clip', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'impress', 'trump', 'shout', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”', 'rise', 'chair', 'anger.', 'audio', 'provid', 'trump’', 'team', 'us', 'media', 'outlet', 'suggest', 'realiti', 'comment', 'pair', 'exchang', 'pleasantri', 'chat', 'subsequ', 'edit', 'dramat', 'effect.\ntaylor', 'budowich,', 'trump’', 'spokesperson,', 'said:', '“thi', 'pathet', 'attempt', 'presid', 'trump', 'reviv', 'career', 'fail', 'televis', 'host.”\nth', 'mutual', 'depend', 'relationship', 'trump', 'morgan', 'produc', 'multipl', 'interview', 'years,', 'gener', 'headlin', 'public', 'eye.\nth', 'premis', 'morgan’', 'present', 'fearless', 'individu', 'imposs', 'television.', 'promot', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'earn', 'host', 'ten', 'million', 'pound', 'contract,', 'repeatedli', 'complain', '“cancel', 'culture”', 'compar', '“woke”', 'polici', 'fascism.', 'morgan’', 'person', 'approach', 'market', 'programm', 'involv', 'pick', 'fight', 'twitter', 'liber', 'leftw', 'critic', 'hope', 'provok', 'reaction.\non', 'morgan’', 'interview', 'trump', 'plan,', 'unknown', 'individu', 'hand', 'dossier', 'critic', 'comment', 'morgan', 'us', 'years.\nin', 'surreal', 'twist', 'extent', 'polit', 'media', 'increasingli', 'entwined,', 'appear', 'individu', 'respons', 'dossier', 'ukip', 'leader', 'nigel', 'farage.', 'he', 'host', 'rival', 'even', 'rightw', 'channel', 'gb', 'news', 'compet', 'morgan’', 'viewers.\nin', 'video', 'post', 'youtub', 'channel,', 'farag', 'recal', 'visit', 'mar-a-lago', 'interview', 'tell', 'trump', 'morgan', '“gone', 'boast', 'uk', 'media”', 'friend', '“stitch', 'up”.\nspeak', 'itv’', 'lorrain', 'thursday', 'morning,', 'morgan', 'appear', 'delight', 'trump’', 'claim', 'advert', 'interview', 'decept', 'edited.\nmorgan,', 'sack', 'editor', 'daili', 'mirror', 'publish', 'fake', 'photos,', 'said:', '“he', 'it’', 'rig', 'election,', 'i', 'rig', 'promo.', 'what', 'i', 'watch', 'interview.', 'it', 'there.', 'we', 'won’t', 'duplicit', 'editing.\n“th', 'promo', 'reflect', 'happened.', 'donald', 'trump', 'angri', 'couldn’t', 'go.', 'but', 'interview', 'they’ll', 'nice', 'exchanges.', 'we', 'before.', 'but', 'simmer', 'anger', 'feel', 'start', 'interview.”\nth', 'present', 'quit', 'itv’', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'refus', 'apologis', 'comment', 'meghan,', 'duchess', 'sussex.', 'he', 'wing', '“but', 'fairli', 'frustrat', 'liberal”', 'victim', 'cancel', 'culture.\nin', 'end,', 'self-describ', '“narcissist', 'self-promotional”', 'morgan', 'lorrain', 'delight', 'trump’', 'furiou', 'reaction', 'interview,', 'public', 'creating:', '“i', 'team,', 'bigger', 'i', 'wake', 'morn', 'person', 'statement', 'donald', 'j', 'trump.', '[at]', '5', 'phone', 'rattled,', 'was!”']",4251,696,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.089887511,0.335055096,30,1129,50.563,11th Grade,12.21

Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily.
China is a major nuclear power.
“It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”.
“I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added.
The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster.
Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’
“I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.”
In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”.
Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”.

At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump.
Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story.
Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had.
“Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.”
“His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”","['as', 'president,', 'donald', 'trump', 'repeatedli', 'aid', 'china', 'manufactur', 'hurrican', 'send', 'damag', 'unit', 'states,', 'unnam', 'senior', 'offici', 'roll', 'stone', 'tuesday.\ntrump', 'reportedli', '“hurrican', 'gun”', 'constitut', 'war,', 'so,', 'us', 'retali', 'militarily.\nchina', 'major', 'nuclear', 'power.\n“it', 'stupid', 'words,”', 'sourc', 'magazine,', 'speaker', '“intim', 'familiar', 'sit', 'president’', 'inquiry”.\n“i', 'sens', 'joke', 'all,”', 'sourc', 'added.\nth', 'news', 'tail', 'defens', 'secretari', 'mark', 'esper’', 'claim,', 'book,', 'trump', 'hit', '“drug', 'labs”', 'mexico', 'missil', 'deni', 'responsibility,', 'hair-rais', 'account', 'foreign', 'polici', 'disaster.\nrol', 'stone', 'quot', 'offici', 'saying:', '“i', '[once]', 'china', '‘made’', 'hurrican', 'send', 'us.', '[trump]', 'technolog', 'existed.', 'one', 'guy', 'responded,', '‘not', 'knowledge,', 'sir.’\n“i', 'i', 'offic', '…', 'i', '[then-]presid', 'heard', '…', 'he', 'time,', 'before,', 'nuke', 'hurricanes.”\nin', 'august', '2019,', 'websit', 'axio', 'report', 'brief', 'hurricanes,', 'trump', 'top', 'officials:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\ntrump', 'reportedli', 'aid', '“look', 'into”', 'notion', 'destroy', 'storm', 'nuclear', 'weapons,', '2016', 'nation', 'geograph', 'call', '“a', 'bad', 'idea”', '“a', 'surpris', 'history”.\ntrump', 'call', 'axio', 'stori', '“ridiculous”.', 'but', 'hurrican', 'rear', 'head', 'week,', '“sharpiegate”.\n0:48', 'donald', 'trump', 'display', 'hurrican', 'dorian', 'map', 'doctor', 'marker', 'pen', '–', 'video\nat', 'oval', 'offic', 'brief', 'hurrican', 'dorian,', 'trump', 'held', 'nation', 'hurrican', 'center', 'map', 'appear', 'alter', 'sharpi', 'pen,', 'hit', 'alabama', '–', 'baseless', 'claim', 'trump.\ntrump', 'comment', 'roll', 'stone', '“hurrican', 'gun”', 'story.\nstephani', 'grisham,', 'press', 'secretari', 'sharpieg', 'report', 'remark', '“nuking”', 'hurricanes,', 'magazin', 'hear', 'convers', 'china', 'hurricanes,', 'surpris', 'had.\n“stuff', 'unusu', 'him,”', 'grisham', 'said.', '“he', 'blurt', 'crazi', 'time,', 'aid', 'it.”\n“hi', 'staff', 'they’d', 'into,', 'know', 'not,', 'he’d', 'forget', '–', 'toddler.”']",2793,463,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.147531577,0.924604134,0.262872565,0.147531577,0,0,0,0.180205656,0,0,0,0,-0.118402778,0.429861111,23,748,54.956,11th Grade,10.833

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has struck western Mexico on the anniversary of two earlier devastating tremors, killing at least one person and causing flooding on the Pacific coast.
“It’s this date, there’s something about the 19th,” said Ernesto Lanzetta, a business owner in the Cuauhtémoc borough of the capital. “The 19th is a day to be feared.”
The quake hit at 1.05pm local time, striking near the town of La Placita de Morelos in the state of Michoacán at a depth of 15km.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued in Mexico City and the US tsunami warning system said there was risk of a tsunami near the coast, and footage posted on social media appeared to show flooding in the city of Manzanillo.
Was anyone killed? President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Twitter that the secretary of the navy told him one person was killed in the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, when a wall at a mall collapsed.
Did the quake cause a lot of damage? Michoacán authorities said there were no immediate reports of significant damage in that state beyond some cracks in buildings in the town of Coalcomán.
Judge orders release of Adnan Syed after more than two decades in prison

A Baltimore judge yesterday ordered the release of Adnan Syed after overturning his conviction for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee – a case chronicled in the hit podcast Serial.
Ruling that the state violated its legal obligation to share exculpatory evidence with Syed’s defense, the circuit court judge, Melissa Phinn, ordered Syed be placed on home detention with GPS monitoring. Phinn also gave the state 30 days to decide whether to seek a new trial or dismiss the case.
As the hearing ended, Phinn said: “All right Mr Syed, you’re free to join your family.”
Outside, Syed smiled as he was shepherded to an SUV, through a sea of cameras and cheering supporters.
What was wrong with the original trial? An assistant state attorney Becky Feldman described details that undermined the conviction including unreliable witness testimony and a potentially biased detective. Feldman said: “I understand how difficult this is, but we need to make sure we hold the correct person accountable.”
What have Lee’s family said? They haven’t responded yet, but in 2016 they said: “It remains hard to see so many run to defend someone who committed a horrible crime, who destroyed our family, who refuses to accept responsibility, when so few are willing to speak up for Hae.”
80s hits and nuclear secrets: security concerns plague Trump’s Mar-a-Lago
View image in fullscreen Thousands of sensitive documents lay nearby as Trump was spinning the Village People in Mar-a-Lago’s not so private club. Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP
At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the US turns DJ for the night, writes Julian Borger.
A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark.
“At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said.
What may have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies.
Why else is Trump in the news this week? Donald Trump made one of his highest-profile embraces to date of the extremist conspiracy group QAnon at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, making the apparently deliberate choice to play music that is virtually indistinguishable from the cult organization’s adopted anthem.

Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region , one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine was in “complete control”.
Britain may not strike a free trade deal with the US for years, Liz Truss has admitted ahead of her first bilateral meeting with Joe Biden. The new prime minister conceded that talks were unlikely to start in the “medium term” as she travelled to New York on her first foreign trip since entering Downing Street.
States are continuing to allow sewage sludge to be spread on cropland as fertilizer and in some cases increasing the amount spread , even as the PFAS-tainted substance has ruined farmers’ livelihoods, poisoned water supplies, contaminated food and put the public’s health at risk.
Republicans will try to impeach Joe Biden every week if they retake the house in November, a rare anti-Trump Republican congressman predicted. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said: “That’s going to look like child’s play in terms of what Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to demand of Kevin McCarthy.”
Stat of the day: rise in STDs, including 26% syphilis spike, sparks alarm

Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases, including a 26% rise in new syphilis infections reported last year, are prompting US health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts. Infection rates for some STDs, including gonorrhoea and syphilis, have been rising for years. Last year the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991 and the total number of cases hit its highest since 1948. HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the situation “out of control”.
Don’t miss this: librarians face unprecedented attacks amid rightwing book bans

If there’s one thing that Jason Kuhl has learned in the 23 years since he earned his degree in library sciences, it’s that the reality of being a librarian hardly squares with the storybook fantasy. “You tell people you’re a librarian and they think you spend your days reading and recommending books,” he said. From active shooter trainings to cancelled bookmobiles, librarians such as Kuhl are caught in the crossfire of a conservative censorship craze. For many librarians, the stress has become unbearable. Increasing numbers are complaining of sleepless nights and having to protect themselves from the deluge of harassment and humiliation tactics.
Climate check: ‘Africa is on the frontlines but not the front pages,’ says Vanessa Nakate

Vanessa Nakate knows what it’s like to be Black and overlooked. In January 2020, an Associated Press photographer cropped Nakate from a picture of youth climate activists, leaving her friend Greta Thunberg and three other white young women in the shot. It triggered widespread outrage, rightly so, but Nakate regards that very personal experience as a symbol of how the voices and experiences of Black – and Brown and Indigenous – communities are routinely erased. “Africa is on the frontlines of the climate crisis but it’s not on the front pages of the world’s newspapers,” says Nakate.
Last Thing: a pricey clothes rack? The people struggling to resell their Pelotons
View image in fullscreen ‘We brought it up two flights of stairs, which was the biggest workout that I got from it this whole time.’ Illustration: Marta Parszeniew/The Guardian
During the pandemic, Peloton became known as one of the small group of “winners” along with Netflix and Amazon. Over the last year, however, the enthusiasm has waned. The company reported $1.2bn in losses in the second quarter of 2022. The reason for Peloton’s flop era is obvious: once people could start exercising in gyms, the need for an expensive home exercise bike disappeared. Thousands of bikes now appear on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist, but are people able to recoup some of their initial investment? Or are they stuck with what has become the most expensive clothes rack in history?

On Wednesday the CEO of the Regional Airline Association, Faye Malarkey Black, told the US House transportation and infrastructure committee that over the next 15 years, nearly 50% of the commercial airline workforce will be forced to retire because they will reach the age of 65.
There are 70% more pilots between the ages of 43 and 64 than those between 21 and 42, Black said. “Reflective of the high cost of flight education and training, the ‘under 30 years of age’ cohort of pilots is the smallest at about 8% of total pilots,” she added.
As a result, 2,225 pilots must retire this year and required retirements will peak in 2029 at 3,750, when pilots who are now 58 will turn 65.
The Regional Airline Association represents regional carriers that offer feeder services to larger airlines which are facing their own set of pilot shortages. The shortages have driven larger carriers such as United, American and Delta to hire pilots from regional airlines.
According to Black, 12 large carriers have had to hire 13,128 pilots in 2022, sourcing “nearly all these pilots from regional airlines”.
The regional airline industry in turn is currently suffering from a “devastating pilot shortage” despite soaring passenger demand. The shortage, which has been growing for decades, has been largely driven by the “inability to create a sustainable pipeline of new pilots”, Black said.
One of the main challenges is the Federal Aviation Administration’s “inaction in advancing and evolving pilot training standards”, Black told the panel, adding that most pilots only have access to an hours-based pilot qualification standard which “incorporates little actual training after completing flight school”.
This has resulted in more pilot candidates failing out today than they did before qualification standards “favored flight time over quality training”, she said.
The loss of flights and declining pilots are bleakly reflected in medium- and large-sized airports across the country. Forty-two states for now have less air service than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Fourteen of those states have lost at least 20% of their service.
Meanwhile, over 500 regional aircraft are idly parked and the aircraft that have remained in service are currently underutilized, Black said.
Other factors contributing to the shortage of pilots include high training costs. Flight education and training at FAA-certificated pilot schools costs about $80,000, which can then increase to more than $200,000 when combined with additional expenses from a bachelor’s degree, Black said.
Because of the high costs, only the “most fortunate or affluent’’ pursue a piloting career in an industry that is already lacking in diversity: 95.7% of the profession identifies as white, according to the federal Census Bureau’s statistics on pilots.
One cost-efficient solution proposed by experts is providing simulators more widely, according to the aviation training company FlightSafety International.
“Allowing credit for simulator training for each rating on the ladder to becoming a professional pilot would make high-quality simulator experience an implicit part of the development of commercial pilots,” the CEO of FlightSafety International, Brad Thress, told the committee.
He added: “Increasing the maximum amount of credit for simulator training to a larger portion of a pilot’s flight experience would have a significant positive impact on the safety of our industry.”","['aviat', 'expert', 'warn', 'us', 'airlin', 'industri', 'hit', '“tsunami', 'pilot', 'retirements”', 'come', 'years,', 'fewer', 'travel', 'option', 'price', 'increases.\non', 'wednesday', 'ceo', 'region', 'airlin', 'association,', 'fay', 'malarkey', 'black,', 'us', 'hous', 'transport', 'infrastructur', 'committe', '15', 'years,', '50%', 'commerci', 'airlin', 'workforc', 'forc', 'retir', 'reach', 'age', '65.\nthere', '70%', 'pilot', 'age', '43', '64', '21', '42,', 'black', 'said.', '“reflect', 'cost', 'flight', 'educ', 'training,', '‘under', '30', 'age’', 'cohort', 'pilot', '8%', 'total', 'pilots,”', 'added.\na', 'result,', '2,225', 'pilot', 'retir', 'requir', 'retir', 'peak', '2029', '3,750,', 'pilot', '58', '65.\nthe', 'region', 'airlin', 'associ', 'repres', 'region', 'carrier', 'offer', 'feeder', 'servic', 'larger', 'airlin', 'face', 'set', 'pilot', 'shortages.', 'the', 'shortag', 'driven', 'larger', 'carrier', 'united,', 'american', 'delta', 'hire', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines.\naccord', 'black,', '12', 'carrier', 'hire', '13,128', 'pilot', '2022,', 'sourc', '“nearli', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines”.\nth', 'region', 'airlin', 'industri', 'suffer', '“devast', 'pilot', 'shortage”', 'soar', 'passeng', 'demand.', 'the', 'shortage,', 'grow', 'decades,', 'driven', '“inabl', 'creat', 'sustain', 'pipelin', 'pilots”,', 'black', 'said.\non', 'main', 'challeng', 'feder', 'aviat', 'administration’', '“inact', 'advanc', 'evolv', 'pilot', 'train', 'standards”,', 'black', 'panel,', 'ad', 'pilot', 'access', 'hours-bas', 'pilot', 'qualif', 'standard', '“incorpor', 'actual', 'train', 'complet', 'flight', 'school”.\nthi', 'pilot', 'candid', 'fail', 'qualif', 'standard', '“favor', 'flight', 'qualiti', 'training”,', 'said.\nth', 'loss', 'flight', 'declin', 'pilot', 'bleakli', 'reflect', 'medium-', 'large-s', 'airport', 'country.', 'forty-two', 'air', 'servic', 'covid-19', 'pandemic.', 'fourteen', 'lost', '20%', 'service.\nmeanwhile,', '500', 'region', 'aircraft', 'idli', 'park', 'aircraft', 'remain', 'servic', 'underutilized,', 'black', 'said.\noth', 'factor', 'contribut', 'shortag', 'pilot', 'train', 'costs.', 'flight', 'educ', 'train', 'faa-certif', 'pilot', 'school', 'cost', '$80,000,', 'increas', '$200,000', 'combin', 'addit', 'expens', 'bachelor’', 'degree,', 'black', 'said.\nbecaus', 'costs,', '“most', 'fortun', 'affluent’’', 'pursu', 'pilot', 'career', 'industri', 'lack', 'diversity:', '95.7%', 'profess', 'identifi', 'white,', 'feder', 'censu', 'bureau’', 'statist', 'pilots.\non', 'cost-effici', 'solut', 'propos', 'expert', 'provid', 'simul', 'widely,', 'aviat', 'train', 'compani', 'flightsafeti', 'international.\n“allow', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'rate', 'ladder', 'profession', 'pilot', 'high-qual', 'simul', 'experi', 'implicit', 'develop', 'commerci', 'pilots,”', 'ceo', 'flightsafeti', 'international,', 'brad', 'thress,', 'committee.\nh', 'added:', '“increas', 'maximum', 'amount', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'larger', 'portion', 'pilot’', 'flight', 'experi', 'posit', 'impact', 'safeti', 'industry.”']",3645,554,9,0.291888328,0,0,0,0,0.542515991,0,0,0.238964449,0,0,0,0,0,0.750582171,0,0,0,0,0,0.00625,0.361111111,22,984,35.53,College Level,14.797

In a report released earlier this week and cited by the New York Times, the navy revealed that a slew of problems including poorly organized medical structures, inadequate leadership and undetected drug use had plagued its elite Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal course, leaving many candidates injured and one dead.
Last February, 24-year-old Kyle Mullen died after contracting acute pneumonia following his completion of the course’s most rigorous portion, known as Hell Week.
The course has been described as a “crucible” event designed to expose candidates to extreme stress in a controlled environment, simulating what they might experience in combat. The event, the toughest training in the US military, includes harsh environments such as plunging repeatedly into freezing waters as well as simultaneous sleep and food deprivation.
According to the report, during a post-Hell Week meeting in February 2022 which Mullen attended, candidates were given a copy of a medical debrief that said: “DO NOT go and see other medical providers. We will see you at any time (if it is a true emergency call 911) … If you go and see other medical personnel who do not understand Hell Week they may admit you to the hospital or give you medicines that are not compatible with training.”
Following Mullen’s death, Rear Admiral Peter Garvin, the commander of Naval Education and Training Command, wrote in the report that medical support for trainees was “poorly organized, poorly integrated, and poorly led”.
Instructors deviated from the curriculum and instead adopted measures on “weeding out” candidates and “hunting the back of the pack”. Instructors did not allow rest and recovery in between intense periods of physical training and “continued conducting burnout or hours-long physical training to complete exhaustion, throughout the week preceding Hell Week when it had traditionally been tapered down to allow candidates to rest and heal minor injuries”, the report said.
The commander in charge of the course at the time, Capt Bradley Geary, primarily believed “the current generation had less mental toughness”, the report said.
As some students pulled out of the course, others resorted to illegal drugs to keep up.","['a', 'us', 'navi', 'investig', 'death', 'sailor', '“near', 'perfect', 'storm”', 'issu', 'elit', 'seal', 'train', 'system.\nin', 'report', 'releas', 'earlier', 'cite', 'new', 'york', 'times,', 'navi', 'reveal', 'slew', 'organ', 'medic', 'structures,', 'inadequ', 'leadership', 'undetect', 'drug', 'plagu', 'elit', 'basic', 'underwat', 'demolition/s', 'course,', 'leav', 'candid', 'injur', 'dead.\nlast', 'february,', '24-year-old', 'kyle', 'mullen', 'die', 'contract', 'acut', 'pneumonia', 'complet', 'course’', 'rigor', 'portion,', 'hell', 'week.\nth', '“crucible”', 'event', 'design', 'expos', 'candid', 'extrem', 'stress', 'control', 'environment,', 'simul', 'experi', 'combat.', 'the', 'event,', 'toughest', 'train', 'us', 'military,', 'includ', 'harsh', 'environ', 'plung', 'repeatedli', 'freez', 'water', 'simultan', 'sleep', 'food', 'deprivation.\naccord', 'report,', 'post-hel', 'week', 'meet', 'februari', '2022', 'mullen', 'attended,', 'candid', 'copi', 'medic', 'debrief', 'said:', '“do', 'not', 'medic', 'providers.', 'we', '(if', 'true', 'emerg', 'call', '911)', '…', 'if', 'medic', 'personnel', 'understand', 'hell', 'week', 'admit', 'hospit', 'medicin', 'compat', 'training.”\nfollow', 'mullen’', 'death,', 'rear', 'admir', 'peter', 'garvin,', 'command', 'naval', 'educ', 'train', 'command,', 'wrote', 'report', 'medic', 'support', 'traine', '“poorli', 'organized,', 'integrated,', 'led”.\ninstructor', 'deviat', 'curriculum', 'measur', '“weed', 'out”', 'candid', '“hunt', 'pack”.', 'instructor', 'rest', 'recoveri', 'intens', 'period', 'physic', 'train', '“continu', 'conduct', 'burnout', 'hours-long', 'physic', 'train', 'complet', 'exhaustion,', 'preced', 'hell', 'week', 'tradit', 'taper', 'candid', 'rest', 'heal', 'minor', 'injuries”,', 'report', 'said.\nth', 'command', 'charg', 'time,', 'capt', 'bradley', 'geary,', 'believ', '“the', 'current', 'gener', 'mental', 'toughness”,', 'report', 'said.\na', 'student', 'pull', 'course,', 'resort', 'illeg', 'drug', 'up.']",2368,368,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.218686869,0.510900673,12,654,28.793,College Graduate,17.09

According to US news website Axios, the president said in a meeting with top national security and homeland security officials about the threat of hurricanes: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
“They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can’t we do that?”
Quoting unnamed sources who were present at the meeting, Axios report that the response from one official was “We’ll look into this.”
On Sunday, the White House declined to comment on the Axios report. “We don’t comment on private discussions that the president may or may not have had with his national security team,” it said.
His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad Unnamed official
On Monday, from the G7 summit in France, Trump passed comment of his own.
“The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous,” he tweeted. “I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!”
Axios reported that Trump raised the same issue on another occasion with a senior administration official. This conversation was apparently recorded in a 2017 national security council memo which used the term “nuclear” in reference to the conversation.
Axios quoted a senior official who defended Trump’s ability to ask tough questions: “His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad.”
Shortly after Trump came to power National Geographic published an article pointing out how frequently the idea of nuking hurricanes has been raised over the last few decades. “It’s an appealing thought,” it said, “especially when, during hurricane season, we’re annually reminded of the immense destruction wrought by these storms.
“And it’s probably why, every year for the past six decades, government agencies have received missives from concerned citizens, urging preemptive attacks against hurricanes using nuclear weapons.”
In the article, Nuking Hurricane: The Surprising History of a Really Bad Idea, the magazine pointed out that the response from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was: “Needless to say, this is not a good idea.”","['donald', 'trump', 'reportedli', 'suggest', 'occas', 'us', 'militari', 'bomb', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'landfall.\naccord', 'us', 'news', 'websit', 'axios,', 'meet', 'top', 'secur', 'homeland', 'secur', 'offici', 'threat', 'hurricanes:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\n“they', 'start', 'form', 'africa,', 'they’r', 'move', 'atlantic,', 'drop', 'bomb', 'insid', 'eye', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'it.', 'whi', 'can’t', 'that?”\nquot', 'unnam', 'sourc', 'meeting,', 'axio', 'report', 'respons', 'offici', '“we’ll', 'this.”\non', 'sunday,', 'white', 'hous', 'declin', 'comment', 'axio', 'report.', '“we', 'don’t', 'comment', 'privat', 'discuss', 'secur', 'team,”', 'said.\nhi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad', 'unnam', 'official\non', 'monday,', 'g7', 'summit', 'france,', 'trump', 'pass', 'comment', 'own.\n“th', 'stori', 'axio', 'presid', 'trump', 'blow', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'prior', 'reach', 'shore', 'ridiculous,”', 'tweeted.', '“i', 'this.', 'just', 'fake', 'news!”\naxio', 'report', 'trump', 'rais', 'issu', 'occas', 'senior', 'administr', 'official.', 'thi', 'convers', 'record', '2017', 'secur', 'council', 'memo', 'term', '“nuclear”', 'refer', 'conversation.\naxio', 'quot', 'senior', 'offici', 'defend', 'trump’', 'abil', 'tough', 'questions:', '“hi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad.”\nshortli', 'trump', 'power', 'nation', 'geograph', 'publish', 'articl', 'frequent', 'idea', 'nuke', 'hurrican', 'rais', 'decades.', '“it’', 'appeal', 'thought,”', 'said,', '“especi', 'when,', 'hurrican', 'season,', 'we’r', 'annual', 'remind', 'immens', 'destruct', 'wrought', 'storms.\n“and', 'it’', 'why,', 'decades,', 'govern', 'agenc', 'receiv', 'missiv', 'concern', 'citizens,', 'urg', 'preemptiv', 'attack', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapons.”\nin', 'article,', 'nuke', 'hurricane:', 'the', 'surpris', 'histori', 'realli', 'bad', 'idea,', 'magazin', 'respons', 'nation', 'ocean', 'atmospher', 'administr', 'was:', '“needless', 'say,', 'idea.”']",2467,394,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.960626793,0.136557051,0.15327942,0,0,0,0.187226484,0,0,0,0,-0.296230159,0.64047619,23,670,52.222,11th Grade,10.469

The paper’s Fact Checker column said Trump hit the milestone on 9 July, a day on which he delivered 62 such claims.
About half of them came in an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, among them a claim to have “tremendous support” in the African American community and the charge that Barack Obama and Joe Biden spied on Trump’s campaign in 2016.
The Post created its database during Trump’s first 100 days in office. Staff have since gone through every statement the president has made at press conferences and rallies, in TV appearances and on social media.
In those first 100 days, the Post’s factcheckers counted 492 false or misleading claims, at a rate of about five a day. Since then, the factcheckers note: “The tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger.”
“The notion that Trump would exceed 20,000 claims before he finished his term appeared ludicrous when the Fact Checker started this project,” wrote Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer, and factcheckers Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly.
Over the last 14 months, as events have unfolded around the Mueller report, Trump’s impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd, Trump has averaged 23 false or misleading claims a day.
The column notes Trump has expressed nearly 1,200 lies and misleading claims about the pandemic, many of which revolve around America’s testing capacity. Trump often says the US has the best record on testing. Experts say testing has not been on par with the size of its outbreak.
The Post’s Fact Checker staff found that Trump’s most prolific lie is his claim that the US economy is the best it has ever been.
Political scientists generally agree that a strong economy is the most important factor for a president seeking re-election. The president first made the claim that the economy is the best it has ever been in June 2018 and, the Post wrote, “it quickly became one of his favorites”.

Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century.
Insight into the pressure that was heaped upon Fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, comes from thousands of pages of his communication records obtained by the Washington Post and the BuzzFeed news site, separately, and published on Tuesday.
The emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in the White House coronavirus taskforce serving Trump as the Republican US president.
As Fauci, kept on as a leading Covid adviser to Joe Biden, recently told the Post: “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop.
“I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.”
Among the emails obtained by the Post is one in which he speaks of the “crazy people in this world”, whom Fauci appeared to blame for politicizing the crisis, and who ultimately led to him receiving a full-time security team amid threats from extremist critics.
Others detail his wrangling with White House officials, including an exchange with Marc Short, an aide for the then vice-president, Mike Pence. The context is unclear, but according to the heavily redacted email Short wrote: “You correctly noticed the symptoms but misdiagnosed the root cause.”
“Thanks for the note. Understood,” is Fauci’s reply.
Others show correspondence with counterparts in other countries, such as a reply to George Gao, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention. Gao appeared to be seeking Fauci’s forgiveness for the words “big mistake” that were attributed to him in relation to his American counterpart in an article early on in the crisis about the US not advising the public to wear masks.
“That was [a] journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao wrote.
“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.
US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan , came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and “escaped”.
Among the most revealing emails are those from wealthy or influential correspondents. In one dated 3 April last year, Fauci refers to a conversation with the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, about a “collaborative and hopefully synergistic approach to Covid-19” with Gates’s charitable foundation.
Gates’s foundation director, Emilio Emini, says he is “seriously worried” about the health of Fauci, then 79, given his busy schedule. Fauci thanks Emini for his concern and says: “I will try to engage as much as I can given my current circumstances.”
There are also email exchanges with the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, about the creation of a coronavirus information hub on social media, and one with the actor Morgan Freeman who offers to get Covid-19 messaging out to his 100,000 Twitter followers.
Almost every email from Fauci is unfailingly polite and ends with a simple sign-off: “Tony”. And hidden amid the stacks of weighty correspondence are brief moments of humor, such as a 7 April 2020, exchange with an unidentified recipient, forwarding a link to an online news article headlined: “Cuomo Crush and ‘Fauci Fever – Sexualization of These Men Is a Real Thing on the Internet.”
“It will blow your mind,” Fauci writes. “Our society is really totally nuts.”","['as', 'anthoni', 'fauci,', 'us’', 'lead', 'infecti', 'diseas', 'official,', 'grappl', 'stage', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'spring,', 'pull', 'directions.\ndonald', 'trump’', 'white', 'house,', 'downplay', 'dangers,', 'demand', 'portray', 'outbreak', 'terms;', 'media', 'hungri', 'answers;', 'fauci’', 'email', 'inbox', 'constantli', 'officials,', 'public', 'celebr', 'offer', 'advic', 'seek', 'world’', 'deadliest', 'health', 'crisi', 'century.\ninsight', 'pressur', 'heap', 'fauci,', 'head', 'institut', 'allergi', 'infecti', 'diseases,', 'thousand', 'commun', 'record', 'washington', 'post', 'buzzfe', 'news', 'site,', 'separately,', 'publish', 'tuesday.\nth', 'email', 'offer', 'window', 'chaos,', 'panic', 'confus', 'time,', 'consider', 'difficulti', 'fauci', 'face', 'promin', 'figur', 'white', 'hous', 'coronaviru', 'taskforc', 'serv', 'trump', 'republican', 'us', 'president.\na', 'fauci,', 'lead', 'covid', 'advis', 'joe', 'biden,', 'post:', '“i', 'singl', 'question,', 'bit', 'confus', 'mix', 'messag', 'come', 'white', 'hous', 'what’', 'real', 'scoop.\n“i', 'reput', 'i', 'respond', 'help,', 'take', 'time.', 'and', 'it’', 'consuming,', 'i', 'do.”\namong', 'email', 'post', 'speak', '“crazi', 'world”,', 'fauci', 'appear', 'blame', 'politic', 'crisis,', 'ultim', 'led', 'receiv', 'full-tim', 'secur', 'team', 'amid', 'threat', 'extremist', 'critics.\noth', 'detail', 'wrangl', 'white', 'hous', 'officials,', 'exchang', 'marc', 'short,', 'aid', 'vice-president,', 'mike', 'pence.', 'the', 'context', 'unclear,', 'heavili', 'redact', 'email', 'short', 'wrote:', '“you', 'correctli', 'notic', 'symptom', 'misdiagnos', 'root', 'cause.”\n“thank', 'note.', 'understood,”', 'fauci’', 'reply.\noth', 'correspond', 'counterpart', 'countries,', 'repli', 'georg', 'gao,', 'director', 'chines', 'center', 'diseas', 'control', 'prevention.', 'gao', 'appear', 'seek', 'fauci’', 'forgiv', '“big', 'mistake”', 'attribut', 'relat', 'american', 'counterpart', 'articl', 'crisi', 'us', 'advis', 'public', 'wear', 'masks.\n“that', '[a]', 'journalist’', 'wording.', 'hope', 'understand,”', 'gao', 'wrote.\n“i', 'understand', 'completely.', 'no', 'problem.', 'we', 'together,”', 'fauci', 'replied.\nus-china', 'tension', 'pandem', 'us', 'investig', 'virus,', 'discov', 'wuhan', ',', 'animals,', 'scientif', 'community’', 'posit', 'time,', 'truth', 'theori', 'viru', 'studi', 'laboratori', '“escaped”.\namong', 'reveal', 'email', 'wealthi', 'influenti', 'correspondents.', 'in', 'date', '3', 'april', 'year,', 'fauci', 'refer', 'convers', 'microsoft', 'founder,', 'bill', 'gates,', '“collabor', 'synergist', 'approach', 'covid-19”', 'gates’', 'charit', 'foundation.\ngates’', 'foundat', 'director,', 'emilio', 'emini,', '“serious', 'worried”', 'health', 'fauci,', '79,', 'busi', 'schedule.', 'fauci', 'emini', 'concern', 'says:', '“i', 'engag', 'i', 'current', 'circumstances.”\nther', 'email', 'exchang', 'facebook', 'founder,', 'mark', 'zuckerberg,', 'creation', 'coronaviru', 'hub', 'social', 'media,', 'actor', 'morgan', 'freeman', 'offer', 'covid-19', 'messag', '100,000', 'twitter', 'followers.\nalmost', 'email', 'fauci', 'unfailingli', 'polit', 'simpl', 'sign-off:', '“tony”.', 'and', 'hidden', 'amid', 'stack', 'weighti', 'correspond', 'moment', 'humor,', '7', 'april', '2020,', 'exchang', 'unidentifi', 'recipient,', 'forward', 'link', 'onlin', 'news', 'articl', 'headlined:', '“cuomo', 'crush', '‘fauci', 'fever', '–', 'sexual', 'these', 'men', 'is', 'real', 'thing', 'internet.”\n“it', 'blow', 'mind,”', 'fauci', 'writes.', '“our', 'societi', 'total', 'nuts.”']",4192,668,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014166667,0.249166667,29,1134,44.635,College Level,12.996

A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored, to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”.
During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”.
The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.”
The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.”
He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020.
Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago.
The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”.
The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise.
Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions.
Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia.
Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.”
It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Thursday.
Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.","['former', 'us', 'donald', 'trump', 'appear', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'question', 'lose', '2020', 'election.\na', 'dramat', '30-second', 'advert', 'morgan’', '–', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'featur', 'rupert', 'murdoch’', 'talktv', '–', 'call', 'present', '“dishonest”', '“a', 'fool”.\ndur', 'interview,', 'trump,', '75,', 'appear', 'agit', 'morgan', 'tell', '2020', 'elect', '“free', 'fair”', '“you', 'lost”.\nth', 'responds:', '“onli', 'fool', 'that”.', 'morgan', 'trump', 'fool,', 'replies:', '“i', 'now,', 'yeah.”\nth', '45th', 'appear', 'defens', 'preview,', 'tell', 'morgan:', '“i', 'i’m', 'honest', 'man,', 'honest', 'you,', 'actually.”\nh', 'present', '“i', 'don’t', 'you’r', 'real”', 'morgan', 'fail', 'produc', '“hard', 'evidence”', 'support', 'unfound', 'disprov', 'claim', 'widespread', 'elector', 'fraud', '2020.\ntrump', 'prepar', 'presid', 'lose', 'joe', 'biden', 'ago.\nth', 'advert,', 'promis', '“the', 'explos', 'interview', 'year”,', 'trump', 'appear', 'walk', 'morgan,', 'tell', 'camera', 'crew', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”.\nth', '75-minut', 'screen', 'monday', '8pm,', 'launch', 'murdoch’', 'televis', 'enterprise.\nalthough', 'news', 'uk', 'talktv', 'tradit', 'roll', 'news', 'channel', 'featur', 'entertainment,', 'documentari', 'sport', 'programming,', 'bedrock', 'output', 'current', 'affair', 'discussions.\nmorgan', 'reportedli', 'paid', '£50m', 'host', 'daili', 'talkshow,', 'stream', 'fox', 'nation', 'us', 'air', 'sky', 'news', 'australia.\nspeak', 'hire', 'morgan', 'september,', 'murdoch', 'said:', '“pier', 'broadcast', 'channel', 'afraid', 'hire.', 'pier', 'brilliant', 'presenter,', 'talent', 'journalist', 'think', 'feeling.”\nit', 'morgan', 'announc', 'return', 'itv', 'year,', 'guest', 'lorrain', 'thursday.\nlast', 'left', 'itv', 'breakfast', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'on-air', 'clash', 'weather', 'present', 'alex', 'beresford', 'duke', 'duchess', 'sussex’', 'interview', 'oprah', 'winfrey.']",2346,386,2,0.935979291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.352055061,0,0,0.168859649,0.474122807,16,608,53.125,11th Grade,12.076

A short clip released on Wednesday to promote talkTV, the new Rupert Murdoch-owned TV station, gave the impression that the former US president walked out of an interview with Morgan in anger at the tough line of questioning.
The Murdoch-owned Sun and New York Post tabloids ran front-page news stories on the supposed bust-up as part of a carefully planned global marketing strategy for Morgan’s new show, which launches on Monday.

https://t.co/UxFHVIgi5O pic.twitter.com/Fs9CYYaCcs — The Sun (@TheSun) April 20, 2022
Trump’s team claimed the clip was misleadingly edited to give the impression Trump shouted “turn the camera off” while rising from his chair in anger. Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggested that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was subsequently edited for dramatic effect.
Taylor Budowich, Trump’s spokesperson, said: “This is a pathetic attempt to use President Trump as a way to revive the career of a failed television host.”
The mutually dependent relationship between Trump and Morgan has produced multiple interviews over the years, often generating headlines that keep both in the public eye.
The premise of Morgan’s new national show is that the presenter will be a fearless individual who says the things that are now impossible to say on national television. Promotional interviews for Piers Morgan Uncensored, which will earn its host tens of millions of pounds over the course of his contract, have shown him repeatedly complain about “cancel culture” and compare “woke” policies to fascism. Morgan’s personal approach to marketing the programme involves picking fights on Twitter with liberal or leftwing critics in the hope of provoking a reaction.
One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years.
In a surreal twist that shows the extent to which politics and the media are becoming increasingly entwined, it appears the individual responsible for the dossier was the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. He hosts a rival evening show on the rightwing channel GB News and will be competing with Morgan’s show for many of the same viewers.
In a video posted to his YouTube channel, Farage recalled visiting Mar-a-Lago days before the interview took place and telling Trump that Morgan had “gone around boasting in the UK media” that he was his friend while also “stitching you up”.
Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited.
Morgan, who was once sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photos, said: “He says it’s a rigged election, and he now says I have a rigged promo. What I would say is watch the interview. It will all be there. We won’t be doing any duplicitous editing.
“The promo reflects exactly what happened. Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go. But when people see the interview they’ll see that we have nice exchanges. We always have done before. But simmering is this anger he was feeling about what was said to him before we started the interview.”
The presenter quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain last year after refusing to apologise over comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He has said he is not right wing “but a fairly frustrated liberal” who had been a victim of cancel culture.
In the end, the self-described “narcissistically self-promotional” Morgan told the Lorraine show he was delighted with Trump’s furious reaction to the interview, due to the publicity it was creating: “I said to my team, the only way this can get bigger is if I wake up in the morning to a personal statement from Donald J Trump. [At] 5 am my phone rattled, and there it was!”","['donald', 'trump', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan,', 'claim', 'british', 'televis', 'present', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'video', 'meet', 'creat', 'buzz', 'show.\na', 'short', 'clip', 'releas', 'wednesday', 'promot', 'talktv,', 'rupert', 'murdoch-own', 'tv', 'station,', 'impress', 'us', 'walk', 'interview', 'morgan', 'anger', 'tough', 'questioning.\nth', 'murdoch-own', 'sun', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'tabloid', 'front-pag', 'news', 'stori', 'suppos', 'bust-up', 'care', 'plan', 'global', 'market', 'strategi', 'morgan’', 'show,', 'launch', 'monday.\non', ""tomorrow'"", 'front', 'page:', 'donald', 'trump', 'storm', 'exclus', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'blaze', 'row\nhttps://t.co/uxfhvigi5o', 'pic.twitter.com/fs9cyyacc', '—', 'the', 'sun', '(@thesun)', 'april', '20,', '2022\ntrump’', 'team', 'claim', 'clip', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'impress', 'trump', 'shout', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”', 'rise', 'chair', 'anger.', 'audio', 'provid', 'trump’', 'team', 'us', 'media', 'outlet', 'suggest', 'realiti', 'comment', 'pair', 'exchang', 'pleasantri', 'chat', 'subsequ', 'edit', 'dramat', 'effect.\ntaylor', 'budowich,', 'trump’', 'spokesperson,', 'said:', '“thi', 'pathet', 'attempt', 'presid', 'trump', 'reviv', 'career', 'fail', 'televis', 'host.”\nth', 'mutual', 'depend', 'relationship', 'trump', 'morgan', 'produc', 'multipl', 'interview', 'years,', 'gener', 'headlin', 'public', 'eye.\nth', 'premis', 'morgan’', 'present', 'fearless', 'individu', 'imposs', 'television.', 'promot', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'earn', 'host', 'ten', 'million', 'pound', 'contract,', 'repeatedli', 'complain', '“cancel', 'culture”', 'compar', '“woke”', 'polici', 'fascism.', 'morgan’', 'person', 'approach', 'market', 'programm', 'involv', 'pick', 'fight', 'twitter', 'liber', 'leftw', 'critic', 'hope', 'provok', 'reaction.\non', 'morgan’', 'interview', 'trump', 'plan,', 'unknown', 'individu', 'hand', 'dossier', 'critic', 'comment', 'morgan', 'us', 'years.\nin', 'surreal', 'twist', 'extent', 'polit', 'media', 'increasingli', 'entwined,', 'appear', 'individu', 'respons', 'dossier', 'ukip', 'leader', 'nigel', 'farage.', 'he', 'host', 'rival', 'even', 'rightw', 'channel', 'gb', 'news', 'compet', 'morgan’', 'viewers.\nin', 'video', 'post', 'youtub', 'channel,', 'farag', 'recal', 'visit', 'mar-a-lago', 'interview', 'tell', 'trump', 'morgan', '“gone', 'boast', 'uk', 'media”', 'friend', '“stitch', 'up”.\nspeak', 'itv’', 'lorrain', 'thursday', 'morning,', 'morgan', 'appear', 'delight', 'trump’', 'claim', 'advert', 'interview', 'decept', 'edited.\nmorgan,', 'sack', 'editor', 'daili', 'mirror', 'publish', 'fake', 'photos,', 'said:', '“he', 'it’', 'rig', 'election,', 'i', 'rig', 'promo.', 'what', 'i', 'watch', 'interview.', 'it', 'there.', 'we', 'won’t', 'duplicit', 'editing.\n“th', 'promo', 'reflect', 'happened.', 'donald', 'trump', 'angri', 'couldn’t', 'go.', 'but', 'interview', 'they’ll', 'nice', 'exchanges.', 'we', 'before.', 'but', 'simmer', 'anger', 'feel', 'start', 'interview.”\nth', 'present', 'quit', 'itv’', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'refus', 'apologis', 'comment', 'meghan,', 'duchess', 'sussex.', 'he', 'wing', '“but', 'fairli', 'frustrat', 'liberal”', 'victim', 'cancel', 'culture.\nin', 'end,', 'self-describ', '“narcissist', 'self-promotional”', 'morgan', 'lorrain', 'delight', 'trump’', 'furiou', 'reaction', 'interview,', 'public', 'creating:', '“i', 'team,', 'bigger', 'i', 'wake', 'morn', 'person', 'statement', 'donald', 'j', 'trump.', '[at]', '5', 'phone', 'rattled,', 'was!”']",4251,696,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.089887511,0.335055096,30,1129,50.563,11th Grade,12.21

Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily.
China is a major nuclear power.
“It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”.
“I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added.
The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster.
Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’
“I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.”
In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”.
Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”.

At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump.
Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story.
Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had.
“Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.”

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has struck western Mexico on the anniversary of two earlier devastating tremors, killing at least one person and causing flooding on the Pacific coast.
“It’s this date, there’s something about the 19th,” said Ernesto Lanzetta, a business owner in the Cuauhtémoc borough of the capital. “The 19th is a day to be feared.”
The quake hit at 1.05pm local time, striking near the town of La Placita de Morelos in the state of Michoacán at a depth of 15km.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued in Mexico City and the US tsunami warning system said there was risk of a tsunami near the coast, and footage posted on social media appeared to show flooding in the city of Manzanillo.
Was anyone killed? President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Twitter that the secretary of the navy told him one person was killed in the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, when a wall at a mall collapsed.
Did the quake cause a lot of damage? Michoacán authorities said there were no immediate reports of significant damage in that state beyond some cracks in buildings in the town of Coalcomán.
Judge orders release of Adnan Syed after more than two decades in prison

A Baltimore judge yesterday ordered the release of Adnan Syed after overturning his conviction for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee – a case chronicled in the hit podcast Serial.
Ruling that the state violated its legal obligation to share exculpatory evidence with Syed’s defense, the circuit court judge, Melissa Phinn, ordered Syed be placed on home detention with GPS monitoring. Phinn also gave the state 30 days to decide whether to seek a new trial or dismiss the case.
As the hearing ended, Phinn said: “All right Mr Syed, you’re free to join your family.”
Outside, Syed smiled as he was shepherded to an SUV, through a sea of cameras and cheering supporters.
What was wrong with the original trial? An assistant state attorney Becky Feldman described details that undermined the conviction including unreliable witness testimony and a potentially biased detective. Feldman said: “I understand how difficult this is, but we need to make sure we hold the correct person accountable.”
What have Lee’s family said? They haven’t responded yet, but in 2016 they said: “It remains hard to see so many run to defend someone who committed a horrible crime, who destroyed our family, who refuses to accept responsibility, when so few are willing to speak up for Hae.”
80s hits and nuclear secrets: security concerns plague Trump’s Mar-a-Lago
View image in fullscreen Thousands of sensitive documents lay nearby as Trump was spinning the Village People in Mar-a-Lago’s not so private club. Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP
At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the US turns DJ for the night, writes Julian Borger.
A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark.
“At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said.
What may have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies.
Why else is Trump in the news this week? Donald Trump made one of his highest-profile embraces to date of the extremist conspiracy group QAnon at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, making the apparently deliberate choice to play music that is virtually indistinguishable from the cult organization’s adopted anthem.

Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region , one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine was in “complete control”.
Britain may not strike a free trade deal with the US for years, Liz Truss has admitted ahead of her first bilateral meeting with Joe Biden. The new prime minister conceded that talks were unlikely to start in the “medium term” as she travelled to New York on her first foreign trip since entering Downing Street.
States are continuing to allow sewage sludge to be spread on cropland as fertilizer and in some cases increasing the amount spread , even as the PFAS-tainted substance has ruined farmers’ livelihoods, poisoned water supplies, contaminated food and put the public’s health at risk.
Republicans will try to impeach Joe Biden every week if they retake the house in November, a rare anti-Trump Republican congressman predicted. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said: “That’s going to look like child’s play in terms of what Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to demand of Kevin McCarthy.”
Stat of the day: rise in STDs, including 26% syphilis spike, sparks alarm

Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases, including a 26% rise in new syphilis infections reported last year, are prompting US health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts. Infection rates for some STDs, including gonorrhoea and syphilis, have been rising for years. Last year the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991 and the total number of cases hit its highest since 1948. HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the situation “out of control”.
Don’t miss this: librarians face unprecedented attacks amid rightwing book bans

If there’s one thing that Jason Kuhl has learned in the 23 years since he earned his degree in library sciences, it’s that the reality of being a librarian hardly squares with the storybook fantasy. “You tell people you’re a librarian and they think you spend your days reading and recommending books,” he said. From active shooter trainings to cancelled bookmobiles, librarians such as Kuhl are caught in the crossfire of a conservative censorship craze. For many librarians, the stress has become unbearable. Increasing numbers are complaining of sleepless nights and having to protect themselves from the deluge of harassment and humiliation tactics.
Climate check: ‘Africa is on the frontlines but not the front pages,’ says Vanessa Nakate

Vanessa Nakate knows what it’s like to be Black and overlooked. In January 2020, an Associated Press photographer cropped Nakate from a picture of youth climate activists, leaving her friend Greta Thunberg and three other white young women in the shot. It triggered widespread outrage, rightly so, but Nakate regards that very personal experience as a symbol of how the voices and experiences of Black – and Brown and Indigenous – communities are routinely erased. “Africa is on the frontlines of the climate crisis but it’s not on the front pages of the world’s newspapers,” says Nakate.
Last Thing: a pricey clothes rack? The people struggling to resell their Pelotons

During the pandemic, Peloton became known as one of the small group of “winners” along with Netflix and Amazon. Over the last year, however, the enthusiasm has waned. The company reported $1.2bn in losses in the second quarter of 2022. The reason for Peloton’s flop era is obvious: once people could start exercising in gyms, the need for an expensive home exercise bike disappeared. Thousands of bikes now appear on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist, but are people able to recoup some of their initial investment? Or are they stuck with what has become the most expensive clothes rack in history?

On Wednesday the CEO of the Regional Airline Association, Faye Malarkey Black, told the US House transportation and infrastructure committee that over the next 15 years, nearly 50% of the commercial airline workforce will be forced to retire because they will reach the age of 65.
There are 70% more pilots between the ages of 43 and 64 than those between 21 and 42, Black said. “Reflective of the high cost of flight education and training, the ‘under 30 years of age’ cohort of pilots is the smallest at about 8% of total pilots,” she added.
As a result, 2,225 pilots must retire this year and required retirements will peak in 2029 at 3,750, when pilots who are now 58 will turn 65.
The Regional Airline Association represents regional carriers that offer feeder services to larger airlines which are facing their own set of pilot shortages. The shortages have driven larger carriers such as United, American and Delta to hire pilots from regional airlines.
According to Black, 12 large carriers have had to hire 13,128 pilots in 2022, sourcing “nearly all these pilots from regional airlines”.
The regional airline industry in turn is currently suffering from a “devastating pilot shortage” despite soaring passenger demand. The shortage, which has been growing for decades, has been largely driven by the “inability to create a sustainable pipeline of new pilots”, Black said.
One of the main challenges is the Federal Aviation Administration’s “inaction in advancing and evolving pilot training standards”, Black told the panel, adding that most pilots only have access to an hours-based pilot qualification standard which “incorporates little actual training after completing flight school”.
This has resulted in more pilot candidates failing out today than they did before qualification standards “favored flight time over quality training”, she said.
The loss of flights and declining pilots are bleakly reflected in medium- and large-sized airports across the country. Forty-two states for now have less air service than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Fourteen of those states have lost at least 20% of their service.
Meanwhile, over 500 regional aircraft are idly parked and the aircraft that have remained in service are currently underutilized, Black said.
Other factors contributing to the shortage of pilots include high training costs. Flight education and training at FAA-certificated pilot schools costs about $80,000, which can then increase to more than $200,000 when combined with additional expenses from a bachelor’s degree, Black said.
Because of the high costs, only the “most fortunate or affluent’’ pursue a piloting career in an industry that is already lacking in diversity: 95.7% of the profession identifies as white, according to the federal Census Bureau’s statistics on pilots.
One cost-efficient solution proposed by experts is providing simulators more widely, according to the aviation training company FlightSafety International.
“Allowing credit for simulator training for each rating on the ladder to becoming a professional pilot would make high-quality simulator experience an implicit part of the development of commercial pilots,” the CEO of FlightSafety International, Brad Thress, told the committee.
He added: “Increasing the maximum amount of credit for simulator training to a larger portion of a pilot’s flight experience would have a significant positive impact on the safety of our industry.”","['aviat', 'expert', 'warn', 'us', 'airlin', 'industri', 'hit', '“tsunami', 'pilot', 'retirements”', 'come', 'years,', 'fewer', 'travel', 'option', 'price', 'increases.\non', 'wednesday', 'ceo', 'region', 'airlin', 'association,', 'fay', 'malarkey', 'black,', 'us', 'hous', 'transport', 'infrastructur', 'committe', '15', 'years,', '50%', 'commerci', 'airlin', 'workforc', 'forc', 'retir', 'reach', 'age', '65.\nthere', '70%', 'pilot', 'age', '43', '64', '21', '42,', 'black', 'said.', '“reflect', 'cost', 'flight', 'educ', 'training,', '‘under', '30', 'age’', 'cohort', 'pilot', '8%', 'total', 'pilots,”', 'added.\na', 'result,', '2,225', 'pilot', 'retir', 'requir', 'retir', 'peak', '2029', '3,750,', 'pilot', '58', '65.\nthe', 'region', 'airlin', 'associ', 'repres', 'region', 'carrier', 'offer', 'feeder', 'servic', 'larger', 'airlin', 'face', 'set', 'pilot', 'shortages.', 'the', 'shortag', 'driven', 'larger', 'carrier', 'united,', 'american', 'delta', 'hire', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines.\naccord', 'black,', '12', 'carrier', 'hire', '13,128', 'pilot', '2022,', 'sourc', '“nearli', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines”.\nth', 'region', 'airlin', 'industri', 'suffer', '“devast', 'pilot', 'shortage”', 'soar', 'passeng', 'demand.', 'the', 'shortage,', 'grow', 'decades,', 'driven', '“inabl', 'creat', 'sustain', 'pipelin', 'pilots”,', 'black', 'said.\non', 'main', 'challeng', 'feder', 'aviat', 'administration’', '“inact', 'advanc', 'evolv', 'pilot', 'train', 'standards”,', 'black', 'panel,', 'ad', 'pilot', 'access', 'hours-bas', 'pilot', 'qualif', 'standard', '“incorpor', 'actual', 'train', 'complet', 'flight', 'school”.\nthi', 'pilot', 'candid', 'fail', 'qualif', 'standard', '“favor', 'flight', 'qualiti', 'training”,', 'said.\nth', 'loss', 'flight', 'declin', 'pilot', 'bleakli', 'reflect', 'medium-', 'large-s', 'airport', 'country.', 'forty-two', 'air', 'servic', 'covid-19', 'pandemic.', 'fourteen', 'lost', '20%', 'service.\nmeanwhile,', '500', 'region', 'aircraft', 'idli', 'park', 'aircraft', 'remain', 'servic', 'underutilized,', 'black', 'said.\noth', 'factor', 'contribut', 'shortag', 'pilot', 'train', 'costs.', 'flight', 'educ', 'train', 'faa-certif', 'pilot', 'school', 'cost', '$80,000,', 'increas', '$200,000', 'combin', 'addit', 'expens', 'bachelor’', 'degree,', 'black', 'said.\nbecaus', 'costs,', '“most', 'fortun', 'affluent’’', 'pursu', 'pilot', 'career', 'industri', 'lack', 'diversity:', '95.7%', 'profess', 'identifi', 'white,', 'feder', 'censu', 'bureau’', 'statist', 'pilots.\non', 'cost-effici', 'solut', 'propos', 'expert', 'provid', 'simul', 'widely,', 'aviat', 'train', 'compani', 'flightsafeti', 'international.\n“allow', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'rate', 'ladder', 'profession', 'pilot', 'high-qual', 'simul', 'experi', 'implicit', 'develop', 'commerci', 'pilots,”', 'ceo', 'flightsafeti', 'international,', 'brad', 'thress,', 'committee.\nh', 'added:', '“increas', 'maximum', 'amount', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'larger', 'portion', 'pilot’', 'flight', 'experi', 'posit', 'impact', 'safeti', 'industry.”']",3645,554,9,0.291888328,0,0,0,0,0.542515991,0,0,0.238964449,0,0,0,0,0,0.750582171,0,0,0,0,0,0.00625,0.361111111,22,984,35.53,College Level,14.797

In a report released earlier this week and cited by the New York Times, the navy revealed that a slew of problems including poorly organized medical structures, inadequate leadership and undetected drug use had plagued its elite Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal course, leaving many candidates injured and one dead.
Last February, 24-year-old Kyle Mullen died after contracting acute pneumonia following his completion of the course’s most rigorous portion, known as Hell Week.
The course has been described as a “crucible” event designed to expose candidates to extreme stress in a controlled environment, simulating what they might experience in combat. The event, the toughest training in the US military, includes harsh environments such as plunging repeatedly into freezing waters as well as simultaneous sleep and food deprivation.
According to the report, during a post-Hell Week meeting in February 2022 which Mullen attended, candidates were given a copy of a medical debrief that said: “DO NOT go and see other medical providers. We will see you at any time (if it is a true emergency call 911) … If you go and see other medical personnel who do not understand Hell Week they may admit you to the hospital or give you medicines that are not compatible with training.”
Following Mullen’s death, Rear Admiral Peter Garvin, the commander of Naval Education and Training Command, wrote in the report that medical support for trainees was “poorly organized, poorly integrated, and poorly led”.
Instructors deviated from the curriculum and instead adopted measures on “weeding out” candidates and “hunting the back of the pack”. Instructors did not allow rest and recovery in between intense periods of physical training and “continued conducting burnout or hours-long physical training to complete exhaustion, throughout the week preceding Hell Week when it had traditionally been tapered down to allow candidates to rest and heal minor injuries”, the report said.
The commander in charge of the course at the time, Capt Bradley Geary, primarily believed “the current generation had less mental toughness”, the report said.
As some students pulled out of the course, others resorted to illegal drugs to keep up.","['a', 'us', 'navi', 'investig', 'death', 'sailor', '“near', 'perfect', 'storm”', 'issu', 'elit', 'seal', 'train', 'system.\nin', 'report', 'releas', 'earlier', 'cite', 'new', 'york', 'times,', 'navi', 'reveal', 'slew', 'organ', 'medic', 'structures,', 'inadequ', 'leadership', 'undetect', 'drug', 'plagu', 'elit', 'basic', 'underwat', 'demolition/s', 'course,', 'leav', 'candid', 'injur', 'dead.\nlast', 'february,', '24-year-old', 'kyle', 'mullen', 'die', 'contract', 'acut', 'pneumonia', 'complet', 'course’', 'rigor', 'portion,', 'hell', 'week.\nth', '“crucible”', 'event', 'design', 'expos', 'candid', 'extrem', 'stress', 'control', 'environment,', 'simul', 'experi', 'combat.', 'the', 'event,', 'toughest', 'train', 'us', 'military,', 'includ', 'harsh', 'environ', 'plung', 'repeatedli', 'freez', 'water', 'simultan', 'sleep', 'food', 'deprivation.\naccord', 'report,', 'post-hel', 'week', 'meet', 'februari', '2022', 'mullen', 'attended,', 'candid', 'copi', 'medic', 'debrief', 'said:', '“do', 'not', 'medic', 'providers.', 'we', '(if', 'true', 'emerg', 'call', '911)', '…', 'if', 'medic', 'personnel', 'understand', 'hell', 'week', 'admit', 'hospit', 'medicin', 'compat', 'training.”\nfollow', 'mullen’', 'death,', 'rear', 'admir', 'peter', 'garvin,', 'command', 'naval', 'educ', 'train', 'command,', 'wrote', 'report', 'medic', 'support', 'traine', '“poorli', 'organized,', 'integrated,', 'led”.\ninstructor', 'deviat', 'curriculum', 'measur', '“weed', 'out”', 'candid', '“hunt', 'pack”.', 'instructor', 'rest', 'recoveri', 'intens', 'period', 'physic', 'train', '“continu', 'conduct', 'burnout', 'hours-long', 'physic', 'train', 'complet', 'exhaustion,', 'preced', 'hell', 'week', 'tradit', 'taper', 'candid', 'rest', 'heal', 'minor', 'injuries”,', 'report', 'said.\nth', 'command', 'charg', 'time,', 'capt', 'bradley', 'geary,', 'believ', '“the', 'current', 'gener', 'mental', 'toughness”,', 'report', 'said.\na', 'student', 'pull', 'course,', 'resort', 'illeg', 'drug', 'up.']",2368,368,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.218686869,0.510900673,12,654,28.793,College Graduate,17.09

According to US news website Axios, the president said in a meeting with top national security and homeland security officials about the threat of hurricanes: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
“They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can’t we do that?”
Quoting unnamed sources who were present at the meeting, Axios report that the response from one official was “We’ll look into this.”
On Sunday, the White House declined to comment on the Axios report. “We don’t comment on private discussions that the president may or may not have had with his national security team,” it said.
His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad Unnamed official
On Monday, from the G7 summit in France, Trump passed comment of his own.
“The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous,” he tweeted. “I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!”
Axios reported that Trump raised the same issue on another occasion with a senior administration official. This conversation was apparently recorded in a 2017 national security council memo which used the term “nuclear” in reference to the conversation.
Axios quoted a senior official who defended Trump’s ability to ask tough questions: “His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad.”
Shortly after Trump came to power National Geographic published an article pointing out how frequently the idea of nuking hurricanes has been raised over the last few decades. “It’s an appealing thought,” it said, “especially when, during hurricane season, we’re annually reminded of the immense destruction wrought by these storms.
“And it’s probably why, every year for the past six decades, government agencies have received missives from concerned citizens, urging preemptive attacks against hurricanes using nuclear weapons.”
In the article, Nuking Hurricane: The Surprising History of a Really Bad Idea, the magazine pointed out that the response from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was: “Needless to say, this is not a good idea.”","['donald', 'trump', 'reportedli', 'suggest', 'occas', 'us', 'militari', 'bomb', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'landfall.\naccord', 'us', 'news', 'websit', 'axios,', 'meet', 'top', 'secur', 'homeland', 'secur', 'offici', 'threat', 'hurricanes:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\n“they', 'start', 'form', 'africa,', 'they’r', 'move', 'atlantic,', 'drop', 'bomb', 'insid', 'eye', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'it.', 'whi', 'can’t', 'that?”\nquot', 'unnam', 'sourc', 'meeting,', 'axio', 'report', 'respons', 'offici', '“we’ll', 'this.”\non', 'sunday,', 'white', 'hous', 'declin', 'comment', 'axio', 'report.', '“we', 'don’t', 'comment', 'privat', 'discuss', 'secur', 'team,”', 'said.\nhi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad', 'unnam', 'official\non', 'monday,', 'g7', 'summit', 'france,', 'trump', 'pass', 'comment', 'own.\n“th', 'stori', 'axio', 'presid', 'trump', 'blow', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'prior', 'reach', 'shore', 'ridiculous,”', 'tweeted.', '“i', 'this.', 'just', 'fake', 'news!”\naxio', 'report', 'trump', 'rais', 'issu', 'occas', 'senior', 'administr', 'official.', 'thi', 'convers', 'record', '2017', 'secur', 'council', 'memo', 'term', '“nuclear”', 'refer', 'conversation.\naxio', 'quot', 'senior', 'offici', 'defend', 'trump’', 'abil', 'tough', 'questions:', '“hi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad.”\nshortli', 'trump', 'power', 'nation', 'geograph', 'publish', 'articl', 'frequent', 'idea', 'nuke', 'hurrican', 'rais', 'decades.', '“it’', 'appeal', 'thought,”', 'said,', '“especi', 'when,', 'hurrican', 'season,', 'we’r', 'annual', 'remind', 'immens', 'destruct', 'wrought', 'storms.\n“and', 'it’', 'why,', 'decades,', 'govern', 'agenc', 'receiv', 'missiv', 'concern', 'citizens,', 'urg', 'preemptiv', 'attack', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapons.”\nin', 'article,', 'nuke', 'hurricane:', 'the', 'surpris', 'histori', 'realli', 'bad', 'idea,', 'magazin', 'respons', 'nation', 'ocean', 'atmospher', 'administr', 'was:', '“needless', 'say,', 'idea.”']",2467,394,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.960626793,0.136557051,0.15327942,0,0,0,0.187226484,0,0,0,0,-0.296230159,0.64047619,23,670,52.222,11th Grade,10.469

The paper’s Fact Checker column said Trump hit the milestone on 9 July, a day on which he delivered 62 such claims.
About half of them came in an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, among them a claim to have “tremendous support” in the African American community and the charge that Barack Obama and Joe Biden spied on Trump’s campaign in 2016.
The Post created its database during Trump’s first 100 days in office. Staff have since gone through every statement the president has made at press conferences and rallies, in TV appearances and on social media.
In those first 100 days, the Post’s factcheckers counted 492 false or misleading claims, at a rate of about five a day. Since then, the factcheckers note: “The tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger.”
“The notion that Trump would exceed 20,000 claims before he finished his term appeared ludicrous when the Fact Checker started this project,” wrote Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer, and factcheckers Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly.
Over the last 14 months, as events have unfolded around the Mueller report, Trump’s impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd, Trump has averaged 23 false or misleading claims a day.
The column notes Trump has expressed nearly 1,200 lies and misleading claims about the pandemic, many of which revolve around America’s testing capacity. Trump often says the US has the best record on testing. Experts say testing has not been on par with the size of its outbreak.
The Post’s Fact Checker staff found that Trump’s most prolific lie is his claim that the US economy is the best it has ever been.
Political scientists generally agree that a strong economy is the most important factor for a president seeking re-election. The president first made the claim that the economy is the best it has ever been in June 2018 and, the Post wrote, “it quickly became one of his favorites”.
But Trump has since “been forced to adapt [the message] for the tough economic times, and doing so has made it even more fantastic. Whereas he used to say it was the best economy in US history, he now often recalls that he achieved ‘the best economy in the history of the world’.”","['donald', 'trump', '20,000', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'office,', 'washington', 'post,', 'identifi', '“tsunami', 'untruths”', 'eman', 'oval', 'office.\nth', 'paper’', 'fact', 'checker', 'column', 'trump', 'hit', 'mileston', '9', 'july,', 'deliv', '62', 'claims.\nabout', 'half', 'interview', 'fox', 'news', 'host', 'sean', 'hannity,', 'claim', '“tremend', 'support”', 'african', 'american', 'commun', 'charg', 'barack', 'obama', 'joe', 'biden', 'spi', 'trump’', 'campaign', '2016.\nthe', 'post', 'creat', 'databas', 'trump’', '100', 'office.', 'staff', 'statement', 'press', 'confer', 'rallies,', 'tv', 'appear', 'social', 'media.\nin', '100', 'days,', 'post’', 'factcheck', 'count', '492', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claims,', 'rate', 'day.', 'sinc', 'then,', 'factcheck', 'note:', '“the', 'tsunami', 'untruth', 'loom', 'larger', 'larger.”\n“th', 'notion', 'trump', 'exceed', '20,000', 'claim', 'finish', 'term', 'appear', 'ludicr', 'fact', 'checker', 'start', 'project,”', 'wrote', 'glenn', 'kessler,', 'editor', 'chief', 'writer,', 'factcheck', 'salvador', 'rizzo', 'meg', 'kelly.\nov', '14', 'months,', 'event', 'unfold', 'mueller', 'report,', 'trump’', 'impeachment,', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'polic', 'kill', 'georg', 'floyd,', 'trump', 'averag', '23', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'day.\nth', 'column', 'note', 'trump', 'express', '1,200', 'lie', 'mislead', 'claim', 'pandemic,', 'revolv', 'america’', 'test', 'capacity.', 'trump', 'us', 'record', 'testing.', 'expert', 'test', 'par', 'size', 'outbreak.\nth', 'post’', 'fact', 'checker', 'staff', 'trump’', 'prolif', 'lie', 'claim', 'us', 'economi', 'been.\npolit', 'scientist', 'agre', 'strong', 'economi', 'factor', 'seek', 're-election.', 'the', 'claim', 'economi', 'june', '2018', 'and,', 'post', 'wrote,', '“it', 'favorites”.\nbut', 'trump', '“been', 'forc', 'adapt', '[the', 'message]', 'tough', 'econom', 'times,', 'fantastic.', 'wherea', 'economi', 'us', 'history,', 'recal', 'achiev', '‘the', 'economi', 'histori', 'world’.”']",2395,400,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034567901,0.411111111,17,626,54.691,11th Grade,11.71

Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century.
Insight into the pressure that was heaped upon Fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, comes from thousands of pages of his communication records obtained by the Washington Post and the BuzzFeed news site, separately, and published on Tuesday.
The emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in the White House coronavirus taskforce serving Trump as the Republican US president.
As Fauci, kept on as a leading Covid adviser to Joe Biden, recently told the Post: “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop.
“I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.”
Among the emails obtained by the Post is one in which he speaks of the “crazy people in this world”, whom Fauci appeared to blame for politicizing the crisis, and who ultimately led to him receiving a full-time security team amid threats from extremist critics.
Others detail his wrangling with White House officials, including an exchange with Marc Short, an aide for the then vice-president, Mike Pence. The context is unclear, but according to the heavily redacted email Short wrote: “You correctly noticed the symptoms but misdiagnosed the root cause.”
“Thanks for the note. Understood,” is Fauci’s reply.
Others show correspondence with counterparts in other countries, such as a reply to George Gao, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention. Gao appeared to be seeking Fauci’s forgiveness for the words “big mistake” that were attributed to him in relation to his American counterpart in an article early on in the crisis about the US not advising the public to wear masks.
“That was [a] journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao wrote.
“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.
US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan , came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and “escaped”.
Among the most revealing emails are those from wealthy or influential correspondents. In one dated 3 April last year, Fauci refers to a conversation with the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, about a “collaborative and hopefully synergistic approach to Covid-19” with Gates’s charitable foundation.
Gates’s foundation director, Emilio Emini, says he is “seriously worried” about the health of Fauci, then 79, given his busy schedule. Fauci thanks Emini for his concern and says: “I will try to engage as much as I can given my current circumstances.”
There are also email exchanges with the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, about the creation of a coronavirus information hub on social media, and one with the actor Morgan Freeman who offers to get Covid-19 messaging out to his 100,000 Twitter followers.
Almost every email from Fauci is unfailingly polite and ends with a simple sign-off: “Tony”. And hidden amid the stacks of weighty correspondence are brief moments of humor, such as a 7 April 2020, exchange with an unidentified recipient, forwarding a link to an online news article headlined: “Cuomo Crush and ‘Fauci Fever – Sexualization of These Men Is a Real Thing on the Internet.”

A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored, to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”.
During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”.
The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.”
The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.”
He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020.
Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago.
The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”.
The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise.
Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions.
Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia.
Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.”
It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Thursday.
Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.","['former', 'us', 'donald', 'trump', 'appear', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'question', 'lose', '2020', 'election.\na', 'dramat', '30-second', 'advert', 'morgan’', '–', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'featur', 'rupert', 'murdoch’', 'talktv', '–', 'call', 'present', '“dishonest”', '“a', 'fool”.\ndur', 'interview,', 'trump,', '75,', 'appear', 'agit', 'morgan', 'tell', '2020', 'elect', '“free', 'fair”', '“you', 'lost”.\nth', 'responds:', '“onli', 'fool', 'that”.', 'morgan', 'trump', 'fool,', 'replies:', '“i', 'now,', 'yeah.”\nth', '45th', 'appear', 'defens', 'preview,', 'tell', 'morgan:', '“i', 'i’m', 'honest', 'man,', 'honest', 'you,', 'actually.”\nh', 'present', '“i', 'don’t', 'you’r', 'real”', 'morgan', 'fail', 'produc', '“hard', 'evidence”', 'support', 'unfound', 'disprov', 'claim', 'widespread', 'elector', 'fraud', '2020.\ntrump', 'prepar', 'presid', 'lose', 'joe', 'biden', 'ago.\nth', 'advert,', 'promis', '“the', 'explos', 'interview', 'year”,', 'trump', 'appear', 'walk', 'morgan,', 'tell', 'camera', 'crew', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”.\nth', '75-minut', 'screen', 'monday', '8pm,', 'launch', 'murdoch’', 'televis', 'enterprise.\nalthough', 'news', 'uk', 'talktv', 'tradit', 'roll', 'news', 'channel', 'featur', 'entertainment,', 'documentari', 'sport', 'programming,', 'bedrock', 'output', 'current', 'affair', 'discussions.\nmorgan', 'reportedli', 'paid', '£50m', 'host', 'daili', 'talkshow,', 'stream', 'fox', 'nation', 'us', 'air', 'sky', 'news', 'australia.\nspeak', 'hire', 'morgan', 'september,', 'murdoch', 'said:', '“pier', 'broadcast', 'channel', 'afraid', 'hire.', 'pier', 'brilliant', 'presenter,', 'talent', 'journalist', 'think', 'feeling.”\nit', 'morgan', 'announc', 'return', 'itv', 'year,', 'guest', 'lorrain', 'thursday.\nlast', 'left', 'itv', 'breakfast', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'on-air', 'clash', 'weather', 'present', 'alex', 'beresford', 'duke', 'duchess', 'sussex’', 'interview', 'oprah', 'winfrey.']",2346,386,2,0.935979291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.352055061,0,0,0.168859649,0.474122807,16,608,53.125,11th Grade,12.076

A short clip released on Wednesday to promote talkTV, the new Rupert Murdoch-owned TV station, gave the impression that the former US president walked out of an interview with Morgan in anger at the tough line of questioning.
The Murdoch-owned Sun and New York Post tabloids ran front-page news stories on the supposed bust-up as part of a carefully planned global marketing strategy for Morgan’s new show, which launches on Monday.

Trump’s team claimed the clip was misleadingly edited to give the impression Trump shouted “turn the camera off” while rising from his chair in anger. Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggested that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was subsequently edited for dramatic effect.
Taylor Budowich, Trump’s spokesperson, said: “This is a pathetic attempt to use President Trump as a way to revive the career of a failed television host.”
The mutually dependent relationship between Trump and Morgan has produced multiple interviews over the years, often generating headlines that keep both in the public eye.
The premise of Morgan’s new national show is that the presenter will be a fearless individual who says the things that are now impossible to say on national television. Promotional interviews for Piers Morgan Uncensored, which will earn its host tens of millions of pounds over the course of his contract, have shown him repeatedly complain about “cancel culture” and compare “woke” policies to fascism. Morgan’s personal approach to marketing the programme involves picking fights on Twitter with liberal or leftwing critics in the hope of provoking a reaction.
One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years.
In a surreal twist that shows the extent to which politics and the media are becoming increasingly entwined, it appears the individual responsible for the dossier was the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. He hosts a rival evening show on the rightwing channel GB News and will be competing with Morgan’s show for many of the same viewers.
In a video posted to his YouTube channel, Farage recalled visiting Mar-a-Lago days before the interview took place and telling Trump that Morgan had “gone around boasting in the UK media” that he was his friend while also “stitching you up”.
Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited.
Morgan, who was once sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photos, said: “He says it’s a rigged election, and he now says I have a rigged promo. What I would say is watch the interview. It will all be there. We won’t be doing any duplicitous editing.
“The promo reflects exactly what happened. Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go. But when people see the interview they’ll see that we have nice exchanges. We always have done before. But simmering is this anger he was feeling about what was said to him before we started the interview.”
The presenter quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain last year after refusing to apologise over comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He has said he is not right wing “but a fairly frustrated liberal” who had been a victim of cancel culture.
In the end, the self-described “narcissistically self-promotional” Morgan told the Lorraine show he was delighted with Trump’s furious reaction to the interview, due to the publicity it was creating: “I said to my team, the only way this can get bigger is if I wake up in the morning to a personal statement from Donald J Trump. [At] 5 am my phone rattled, and there it was!”","['donald', 'trump', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan,', 'claim', 'british', 'televis', 'present', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'video', 'meet', 'creat', 'buzz', 'show.\na', 'short', 'clip', 'releas', 'wednesday', 'promot', 'talktv,', 'rupert', 'murdoch-own', 'tv', 'station,', 'impress', 'us', 'walk', 'interview', 'morgan', 'anger', 'tough', 'questioning.\nth', 'murdoch-own', 'sun', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'tabloid', 'front-pag', 'news', 'stori', 'suppos', 'bust-up', 'care', 'plan', 'global', 'market', 'strategi', 'morgan’', 'show,', 'launch', 'monday.\non', ""tomorrow'"", 'front', 'page:', 'donald', 'trump', 'storm', 'exclus', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'blaze', 'row\nhttps://t.co/uxfhvigi5o', 'pic.twitter.com/fs9cyyacc', '—', 'the', 'sun', '(@thesun)', 'april', '20,', '2022\ntrump’', 'team', 'claim', 'clip', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'impress', 'trump', 'shout', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”', 'rise', 'chair', 'anger.', 'audio', 'provid', 'trump’', 'team', 'us', 'media', 'outlet', 'suggest', 'realiti', 'comment', 'pair', 'exchang', 'pleasantri', 'chat', 'subsequ', 'edit', 'dramat', 'effect.\ntaylor', 'budowich,', 'trump’', 'spokesperson,', 'said:', '“thi', 'pathet', 'attempt', 'presid', 'trump', 'reviv', 'career', 'fail', 'televis', 'host.”\nth', 'mutual', 'depend', 'relationship', 'trump', 'morgan', 'produc', 'multipl', 'interview', 'years,', 'gener', 'headlin', 'public', 'eye.\nth', 'premis', 'morgan’', 'present', 'fearless', 'individu', 'imposs', 'television.', 'promot', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'earn', 'host', 'ten', 'million', 'pound', 'contract,', 'repeatedli', 'complain', '“cancel', 'culture”', 'compar', '“woke”', 'polici', 'fascism.', 'morgan’', 'person', 'approach', 'market', 'programm', 'involv', 'pick', 'fight', 'twitter', 'liber', 'leftw', 'critic', 'hope', 'provok', 'reaction.\non', 'morgan’', 'interview', 'trump', 'plan,', 'unknown', 'individu', 'hand', 'dossier', 'critic', 'comment', 'morgan', 'us', 'years.\nin', 'surreal', 'twist', 'extent', 'polit', 'media', 'increasingli', 'entwined,', 'appear', 'individu', 'respons', 'dossier', 'ukip', 'leader', 'nigel', 'farage.', 'he', 'host', 'rival', 'even', 'rightw', 'channel', 'gb', 'news', 'compet', 'morgan’', 'viewers.\nin', 'video', 'post', 'youtub', 'channel,', 'farag', 'recal', 'visit', 'mar-a-lago', 'interview', 'tell', 'trump', 'morgan', '“gone', 'boast', 'uk', 'media”', 'friend', '“stitch', 'up”.\nspeak', 'itv’', 'lorrain', 'thursday', 'morning,', 'morgan', 'appear', 'delight', 'trump’', 'claim', 'advert', 'interview', 'decept', 'edited.\nmorgan,', 'sack', 'editor', 'daili', 'mirror', 'publish', 'fake', 'photos,', 'said:', '“he', 'it’', 'rig', 'election,', 'i', 'rig', 'promo.', 'what', 'i', 'watch', 'interview.', 'it', 'there.', 'we', 'won’t', 'duplicit', 'editing.\n“th', 'promo', 'reflect', 'happened.', 'donald', 'trump', 'angri', 'couldn’t', 'go.', 'but', 'interview', 'they’ll', 'nice', 'exchanges.', 'we', 'before.', 'but', 'simmer', 'anger', 'feel', 'start', 'interview.”\nth', 'present', 'quit', 'itv’', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'refus', 'apologis', 'comment', 'meghan,', 'duchess', 'sussex.', 'he', 'wing', '“but', 'fairli', 'frustrat', 'liberal”', 'victim', 'cancel', 'culture.\nin', 'end,', 'self-describ', '“narcissist', 'self-promotional”', 'morgan', 'lorrain', 'delight', 'trump’', 'furiou', 'reaction', 'interview,', 'public', 'creating:', '“i', 'team,', 'bigger', 'i', 'wake', 'morn', 'person', 'statement', 'donald', 'j', 'trump.', '[at]', '5', 'phone', 'rattled,', 'was!”']",4251,696,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.089887511,0.335055096,30,1129,50.563,11th Grade,12.21

Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily.
China is a major nuclear power.
“It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”.
“I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added.
The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster.
Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’
“I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.”
In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”.
Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”.

At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump.
Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story.
Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had.
“Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.”

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has struck western Mexico on the anniversary of two earlier devastating tremors, killing at least one person and causing flooding on the Pacific coast.
“It’s this date, there’s something about the 19th,” said Ernesto Lanzetta, a business owner in the Cuauhtémoc borough of the capital. “The 19th is a day to be feared.”
The quake hit at 1.05pm local time, striking near the town of La Placita de Morelos in the state of Michoacán at a depth of 15km.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued in Mexico City and the US tsunami warning system said there was risk of a tsunami near the coast, and footage posted on social media appeared to show flooding in the city of Manzanillo.
Was anyone killed? President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Twitter that the secretary of the navy told him one person was killed in the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, when a wall at a mall collapsed.
Did the quake cause a lot of damage? Michoacán authorities said there were no immediate reports of significant damage in that state beyond some cracks in buildings in the town of Coalcomán.
Judge orders release of Adnan Syed after more than two decades in prison

A Baltimore judge yesterday ordered the release of Adnan Syed after overturning his conviction for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee – a case chronicled in the hit podcast Serial.
Ruling that the state violated its legal obligation to share exculpatory evidence with Syed’s defense, the circuit court judge, Melissa Phinn, ordered Syed be placed on home detention with GPS monitoring. Phinn also gave the state 30 days to decide whether to seek a new trial or dismiss the case.
As the hearing ended, Phinn said: “All right Mr Syed, you’re free to join your family.”
Outside, Syed smiled as he was shepherded to an SUV, through a sea of cameras and cheering supporters.
What was wrong with the original trial? An assistant state attorney Becky Feldman described details that undermined the conviction including unreliable witness testimony and a potentially biased detective. Feldman said: “I understand how difficult this is, but we need to make sure we hold the correct person accountable.”
What have Lee’s family said? They haven’t responded yet, but in 2016 they said: “It remains hard to see so many run to defend someone who committed a horrible crime, who destroyed our family, who refuses to accept responsibility, when so few are willing to speak up for Hae.”

At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the US turns DJ for the night, writes Julian Borger.
A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark.
“At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said.
What may have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies.
Why else is Trump in the news this week? Donald Trump made one of his highest-profile embraces to date of the extremist conspiracy group QAnon at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, making the apparently deliberate choice to play music that is virtually indistinguishable from the cult organization’s adopted anthem.

Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region , one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine was in “complete control”.
Britain may not strike a free trade deal with the US for years, Liz Truss has admitted ahead of her first bilateral meeting with Joe Biden. The new prime minister conceded that talks were unlikely to start in the “medium term” as she travelled to New York on her first foreign trip since entering Downing Street.
States are continuing to allow sewage sludge to be spread on cropland as fertilizer and in some cases increasing the amount spread , even as the PFAS-tainted substance has ruined farmers’ livelihoods, poisoned water supplies, contaminated food and put the public’s health at risk.
Republicans will try to impeach Joe Biden every week if they retake the house in November, a rare anti-Trump Republican congressman predicted. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said: “That’s going to look like child’s play in terms of what Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to demand of Kevin McCarthy.”
Stat of the day: rise in STDs, including 26% syphilis spike, sparks alarm

Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases, including a 26% rise in new syphilis infections reported last year, are prompting US health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts. Infection rates for some STDs, including gonorrhoea and syphilis, have been rising for years. Last year the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991 and the total number of cases hit its highest since 1948. HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the situation “out of control”.
Don’t miss this: librarians face unprecedented attacks amid rightwing book bans

If there’s one thing that Jason Kuhl has learned in the 23 years since he earned his degree in library sciences, it’s that the reality of being a librarian hardly squares with the storybook fantasy. “You tell people you’re a librarian and they think you spend your days reading and recommending books,” he said. From active shooter trainings to cancelled bookmobiles, librarians such as Kuhl are caught in the crossfire of a conservative censorship craze. For many librarians, the stress has become unbearable. Increasing numbers are complaining of sleepless nights and having to protect themselves from the deluge of harassment and humiliation tactics.
Climate check: ‘Africa is on the frontlines but not the front pages,’ says Vanessa Nakate

Vanessa Nakate knows what it’s like to be Black and overlooked. In January 2020, an Associated Press photographer cropped Nakate from a picture of youth climate activists, leaving her friend Greta Thunberg and three other white young women in the shot. It triggered widespread outrage, rightly so, but Nakate regards that very personal experience as a symbol of how the voices and experiences of Black – and Brown and Indigenous – communities are routinely erased. “Africa is on the frontlines of the climate crisis but it’s not on the front pages of the world’s newspapers,” says Nakate.
Last Thing: a pricey clothes rack? The people struggling to resell their Pelotons

During the pandemic, Peloton became known as one of the small group of “winners” along with Netflix and Amazon. Over the last year, however, the enthusiasm has waned. The company reported $1.2bn in losses in the second quarter of 2022. The reason for Peloton’s flop era is obvious: once people could start exercising in gyms, the need for an expensive home exercise bike disappeared. Thousands of bikes now appear on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist, but are people able to recoup some of their initial investment? Or are they stuck with what has become the most expensive clothes rack in history?

On Wednesday the CEO of the Regional Airline Association, Faye Malarkey Black, told the US House transportation and infrastructure committee that over the next 15 years, nearly 50% of the commercial airline workforce will be forced to retire because they will reach the age of 65.
There are 70% more pilots between the ages of 43 and 64 than those between 21 and 42, Black said. “Reflective of the high cost of flight education and training, the ‘under 30 years of age’ cohort of pilots is the smallest at about 8% of total pilots,” she added.
As a result, 2,225 pilots must retire this year and required retirements will peak in 2029 at 3,750, when pilots who are now 58 will turn 65.
The Regional Airline Association represents regional carriers that offer feeder services to larger airlines which are facing their own set of pilot shortages. The shortages have driven larger carriers such as United, American and Delta to hire pilots from regional airlines.
According to Black, 12 large carriers have had to hire 13,128 pilots in 2022, sourcing “nearly all these pilots from regional airlines”.
The regional airline industry in turn is currently suffering from a “devastating pilot shortage” despite soaring passenger demand. The shortage, which has been growing for decades, has been largely driven by the “inability to create a sustainable pipeline of new pilots”, Black said.
One of the main challenges is the Federal Aviation Administration’s “inaction in advancing and evolving pilot training standards”, Black told the panel, adding that most pilots only have access to an hours-based pilot qualification standard which “incorporates little actual training after completing flight school”.
This has resulted in more pilot candidates failing out today than they did before qualification standards “favored flight time over quality training”, she said.
The loss of flights and declining pilots are bleakly reflected in medium- and large-sized airports across the country. Forty-two states for now have less air service than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Fourteen of those states have lost at least 20% of their service.
Meanwhile, over 500 regional aircraft are idly parked and the aircraft that have remained in service are currently underutilized, Black said.
Other factors contributing to the shortage of pilots include high training costs. Flight education and training at FAA-certificated pilot schools costs about $80,000, which can then increase to more than $200,000 when combined with additional expenses from a bachelor’s degree, Black said.
Because of the high costs, only the “most fortunate or affluent’’ pursue a piloting career in an industry that is already lacking in diversity: 95.7% of the profession identifies as white, according to the federal Census Bureau’s statistics on pilots.
One cost-efficient solution proposed by experts is providing simulators more widely, according to the aviation training company FlightSafety International.
“Allowing credit for simulator training for each rating on the ladder to becoming a professional pilot would make high-quality simulator experience an implicit part of the development of commercial pilots,” the CEO of FlightSafety International, Brad Thress, told the committee.
He added: “Increasing the maximum amount of credit for simulator training to a larger portion of a pilot’s flight experience would have a significant positive impact on the safety of our industry.”","['aviat', 'expert', 'warn', 'us', 'airlin', 'industri', 'hit', '“tsunami', 'pilot', 'retirements”', 'come', 'years,', 'fewer', 'travel', 'option', 'price', 'increases.\non', 'wednesday', 'ceo', 'region', 'airlin', 'association,', 'fay', 'malarkey', 'black,', 'us', 'hous', 'transport', 'infrastructur', 'committe', '15', 'years,', '50%', 'commerci', 'airlin', 'workforc', 'forc', 'retir', 'reach', 'age', '65.\nthere', '70%', 'pilot', 'age', '43', '64', '21', '42,', 'black', 'said.', '“reflect', 'cost', 'flight', 'educ', 'training,', '‘under', '30', 'age’', 'cohort', 'pilot', '8%', 'total', 'pilots,”', 'added.\na', 'result,', '2,225', 'pilot', 'retir', 'requir', 'retir', 'peak', '2029', '3,750,', 'pilot', '58', '65.\nthe', 'region', 'airlin', 'associ', 'repres', 'region', 'carrier', 'offer', 'feeder', 'servic', 'larger', 'airlin', 'face', 'set', 'pilot', 'shortages.', 'the', 'shortag', 'driven', 'larger', 'carrier', 'united,', 'american', 'delta', 'hire', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines.\naccord', 'black,', '12', 'carrier', 'hire', '13,128', 'pilot', '2022,', 'sourc', '“nearli', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines”.\nth', 'region', 'airlin', 'industri', 'suffer', '“devast', 'pilot', 'shortage”', 'soar', 'passeng', 'demand.', 'the', 'shortage,', 'grow', 'decades,', 'driven', '“inabl', 'creat', 'sustain', 'pipelin', 'pilots”,', 'black', 'said.\non', 'main', 'challeng', 'feder', 'aviat', 'administration’', '“inact', 'advanc', 'evolv', 'pilot', 'train', 'standards”,', 'black', 'panel,', 'ad', 'pilot', 'access', 'hours-bas', 'pilot', 'qualif', 'standard', '“incorpor', 'actual', 'train', 'complet', 'flight', 'school”.\nthi', 'pilot', 'candid', 'fail', 'qualif', 'standard', '“favor', 'flight', 'qualiti', 'training”,', 'said.\nth', 'loss', 'flight', 'declin', 'pilot', 'bleakli', 'reflect', 'medium-', 'large-s', 'airport', 'country.', 'forty-two', 'air', 'servic', 'covid-19', 'pandemic.', 'fourteen', 'lost', '20%', 'service.\nmeanwhile,', '500', 'region', 'aircraft', 'idli', 'park', 'aircraft', 'remain', 'servic', 'underutilized,', 'black', 'said.\noth', 'factor', 'contribut', 'shortag', 'pilot', 'train', 'costs.', 'flight', 'educ', 'train', 'faa-certif', 'pilot', 'school', 'cost', '$80,000,', 'increas', '$200,000', 'combin', 'addit', 'expens', 'bachelor’', 'degree,', 'black', 'said.\nbecaus', 'costs,', '“most', 'fortun', 'affluent’’', 'pursu', 'pilot', 'career', 'industri', 'lack', 'diversity:', '95.7%', 'profess', 'identifi', 'white,', 'feder', 'censu', 'bureau’', 'statist', 'pilots.\non', 'cost-effici', 'solut', 'propos', 'expert', 'provid', 'simul', 'widely,', 'aviat', 'train', 'compani', 'flightsafeti', 'international.\n“allow', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'rate', 'ladder', 'profession', 'pilot', 'high-qual', 'simul', 'experi', 'implicit', 'develop', 'commerci', 'pilots,”', 'ceo', 'flightsafeti', 'international,', 'brad', 'thress,', 'committee.\nh', 'added:', '“increas', 'maximum', 'amount', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'larger', 'portion', 'pilot’', 'flight', 'experi', 'posit', 'impact', 'safeti', 'industry.”']",3645,554,9,0.291888328,0,0,0,0,0.542515991,0,0,0.238964449,0,0,0,0,0,0.750582171,0,0,0,0,0,0.00625,0.361111111,22,984,35.53,College Level,14.797

In a report released earlier this week and cited by the New York Times, the navy revealed that a slew of problems including poorly organized medical structures, inadequate leadership and undetected drug use had plagued its elite Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal course, leaving many candidates injured and one dead.
Last February, 24-year-old Kyle Mullen died after contracting acute pneumonia following his completion of the course’s most rigorous portion, known as Hell Week.
The course has been described as a “crucible” event designed to expose candidates to extreme stress in a controlled environment, simulating what they might experience in combat. The event, the toughest training in the US military, includes harsh environments such as plunging repeatedly into freezing waters as well as simultaneous sleep and food deprivation.
According to the report, during a post-Hell Week meeting in February 2022 which Mullen attended, candidates were given a copy of a medical debrief that said: “DO NOT go and see other medical providers. We will see you at any time (if it is a true emergency call 911) … If you go and see other medical personnel who do not understand Hell Week they may admit you to the hospital or give you medicines that are not compatible with training.”
Following Mullen’s death, Rear Admiral Peter Garvin, the commander of Naval Education and Training Command, wrote in the report that medical support for trainees was “poorly organized, poorly integrated, and poorly led”.
Instructors deviated from the curriculum and instead adopted measures on “weeding out” candidates and “hunting the back of the pack”. Instructors did not allow rest and recovery in between intense periods of physical training and “continued conducting burnout or hours-long physical training to complete exhaustion, throughout the week preceding Hell Week when it had traditionally been tapered down to allow candidates to rest and heal minor injuries”, the report said.
The commander in charge of the course at the time, Capt Bradley Geary, primarily believed “the current generation had less mental toughness”, the report said.
As some students pulled out of the course, others resorted to illegal drugs to keep up.","['a', 'us', 'navi', 'investig', 'death', 'sailor', '“near', 'perfect', 'storm”', 'issu', 'elit', 'seal', 'train', 'system.\nin', 'report', 'releas', 'earlier', 'cite', 'new', 'york', 'times,', 'navi', 'reveal', 'slew', 'organ', 'medic', 'structures,', 'inadequ', 'leadership', 'undetect', 'drug', 'plagu', 'elit', 'basic', 'underwat', 'demolition/s', 'course,', 'leav', 'candid', 'injur', 'dead.\nlast', 'february,', '24-year-old', 'kyle', 'mullen', 'die', 'contract', 'acut', 'pneumonia', 'complet', 'course’', 'rigor', 'portion,', 'hell', 'week.\nth', '“crucible”', 'event', 'design', 'expos', 'candid', 'extrem', 'stress', 'control', 'environment,', 'simul', 'experi', 'combat.', 'the', 'event,', 'toughest', 'train', 'us', 'military,', 'includ', 'harsh', 'environ', 'plung', 'repeatedli', 'freez', 'water', 'simultan', 'sleep', 'food', 'deprivation.\naccord', 'report,', 'post-hel', 'week', 'meet', 'februari', '2022', 'mullen', 'attended,', 'candid', 'copi', 'medic', 'debrief', 'said:', '“do', 'not', 'medic', 'providers.', 'we', '(if', 'true', 'emerg', 'call', '911)', '…', 'if', 'medic', 'personnel', 'understand', 'hell', 'week', 'admit', 'hospit', 'medicin', 'compat', 'training.”\nfollow', 'mullen’', 'death,', 'rear', 'admir', 'peter', 'garvin,', 'command', 'naval', 'educ', 'train', 'command,', 'wrote', 'report', 'medic', 'support', 'traine', '“poorli', 'organized,', 'integrated,', 'led”.\ninstructor', 'deviat', 'curriculum', 'measur', '“weed', 'out”', 'candid', '“hunt', 'pack”.', 'instructor', 'rest', 'recoveri', 'intens', 'period', 'physic', 'train', '“continu', 'conduct', 'burnout', 'hours-long', 'physic', 'train', 'complet', 'exhaustion,', 'preced', 'hell', 'week', 'tradit', 'taper', 'candid', 'rest', 'heal', 'minor', 'injuries”,', 'report', 'said.\nth', 'command', 'charg', 'time,', 'capt', 'bradley', 'geary,', 'believ', '“the', 'current', 'gener', 'mental', 'toughness”,', 'report', 'said.\na', 'student', 'pull', 'course,', 'resort', 'illeg', 'drug', 'up.']",2368,368,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.218686869,0.510900673,12,654,28.793,College Graduate,17.09

According to US news website Axios, the president said in a meeting with top national security and homeland security officials about the threat of hurricanes: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
“They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can’t we do that?”
Quoting unnamed sources who were present at the meeting, Axios report that the response from one official was “We’ll look into this.”
On Sunday, the White House declined to comment on the Axios report. “We don’t comment on private discussions that the president may or may not have had with his national security team,” it said.
His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad Unnamed official
On Monday, from the G7 summit in France, Trump passed comment of his own.
“The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous,” he tweeted. “I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!”
Axios reported that Trump raised the same issue on another occasion with a senior administration official. This conversation was apparently recorded in a 2017 national security council memo which used the term “nuclear” in reference to the conversation.
Axios quoted a senior official who defended Trump’s ability to ask tough questions: “His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad.”
Shortly after Trump came to power National Geographic published an article pointing out how frequently the idea of nuking hurricanes has been raised over the last few decades. “It’s an appealing thought,” it said, “especially when, during hurricane season, we’re annually reminded of the immense destruction wrought by these storms.
“And it’s probably why, every year for the past six decades, government agencies have received missives from concerned citizens, urging preemptive attacks against hurricanes using nuclear weapons.”
In the article, Nuking Hurricane: The Surprising History of a Really Bad Idea, the magazine pointed out that the response from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was: “Needless to say, this is not a good idea.”","['donald', 'trump', 'reportedli', 'suggest', 'occas', 'us', 'militari', 'bomb', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'landfall.\naccord', 'us', 'news', 'websit', 'axios,', 'meet', 'top', 'secur', 'homeland', 'secur', 'offici', 'threat', 'hurricanes:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\n“they', 'start', 'form', 'africa,', 'they’r', 'move', 'atlantic,', 'drop', 'bomb', 'insid', 'eye', 'hurrican', 'disrupt', 'it.', 'whi', 'can’t', 'that?”\nquot', 'unnam', 'sourc', 'meeting,', 'axio', 'report', 'respons', 'offici', '“we’ll', 'this.”\non', 'sunday,', 'white', 'hous', 'declin', 'comment', 'axio', 'report.', '“we', 'don’t', 'comment', 'privat', 'discuss', 'secur', 'team,”', 'said.\nhi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad', 'unnam', 'official\non', 'monday,', 'g7', 'summit', 'france,', 'trump', 'pass', 'comment', 'own.\n“th', 'stori', 'axio', 'presid', 'trump', 'blow', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'prior', 'reach', 'shore', 'ridiculous,”', 'tweeted.', '“i', 'this.', 'just', 'fake', 'news!”\naxio', 'report', 'trump', 'rais', 'issu', 'occas', 'senior', 'administr', 'official.', 'thi', 'convers', 'record', '2017', 'secur', 'council', 'memo', 'term', '“nuclear”', 'refer', 'conversation.\naxio', 'quot', 'senior', 'offici', 'defend', 'trump’', 'abil', 'tough', 'questions:', '“hi', 'goal', '–', 'catastroph', 'hurrican', 'hit', 'mainland', '–', 'bad.', 'hi', 'object', 'bad.”\nshortli', 'trump', 'power', 'nation', 'geograph', 'publish', 'articl', 'frequent', 'idea', 'nuke', 'hurrican', 'rais', 'decades.', '“it’', 'appeal', 'thought,”', 'said,', '“especi', 'when,', 'hurrican', 'season,', 'we’r', 'annual', 'remind', 'immens', 'destruct', 'wrought', 'storms.\n“and', 'it’', 'why,', 'decades,', 'govern', 'agenc', 'receiv', 'missiv', 'concern', 'citizens,', 'urg', 'preemptiv', 'attack', 'hurrican', 'nuclear', 'weapons.”\nin', 'article,', 'nuke', 'hurricane:', 'the', 'surpris', 'histori', 'realli', 'bad', 'idea,', 'magazin', 'respons', 'nation', 'ocean', 'atmospher', 'administr', 'was:', '“needless', 'say,', 'idea.”']",2467,394,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.960626793,0.136557051,0.15327942,0,0,0,0.187226484,0,0,0,0,-0.296230159,0.64047619,23,670,52.222,11th Grade,10.469

The paper’s Fact Checker column said Trump hit the milestone on 9 July, a day on which he delivered 62 such claims.
About half of them came in an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, among them a claim to have “tremendous support” in the African American community and the charge that Barack Obama and Joe Biden spied on Trump’s campaign in 2016.
The Post created its database during Trump’s first 100 days in office. Staff have since gone through every statement the president has made at press conferences and rallies, in TV appearances and on social media.
In those first 100 days, the Post’s factcheckers counted 492 false or misleading claims, at a rate of about five a day. Since then, the factcheckers note: “The tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger.”
“The notion that Trump would exceed 20,000 claims before he finished his term appeared ludicrous when the Fact Checker started this project,” wrote Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer, and factcheckers Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly.
Over the last 14 months, as events have unfolded around the Mueller report, Trump’s impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd, Trump has averaged 23 false or misleading claims a day.
The column notes Trump has expressed nearly 1,200 lies and misleading claims about the pandemic, many of which revolve around America’s testing capacity. Trump often says the US has the best record on testing. Experts say testing has not been on par with the size of its outbreak.
The Post’s Fact Checker staff found that Trump’s most prolific lie is his claim that the US economy is the best it has ever been.
Political scientists generally agree that a strong economy is the most important factor for a president seeking re-election. The president first made the claim that the economy is the best it has ever been in June 2018 and, the Post wrote, “it quickly became one of his favorites”.
But Trump has since “been forced to adapt [the message] for the tough economic times, and doing so has made it even more fantastic. Whereas he used to say it was the best economy in US history, he now often recalls that he achieved ‘the best economy in the history of the world’.”","['donald', 'trump', '20,000', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'office,', 'washington', 'post,', 'identifi', '“tsunami', 'untruths”', 'eman', 'oval', 'office.\nth', 'paper’', 'fact', 'checker', 'column', 'trump', 'hit', 'mileston', '9', 'july,', 'deliv', '62', 'claims.\nabout', 'half', 'interview', 'fox', 'news', 'host', 'sean', 'hannity,', 'claim', '“tremend', 'support”', 'african', 'american', 'commun', 'charg', 'barack', 'obama', 'joe', 'biden', 'spi', 'trump’', 'campaign', '2016.\nthe', 'post', 'creat', 'databas', 'trump’', '100', 'office.', 'staff', 'statement', 'press', 'confer', 'rallies,', 'tv', 'appear', 'social', 'media.\nin', '100', 'days,', 'post’', 'factcheck', 'count', '492', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claims,', 'rate', 'day.', 'sinc', 'then,', 'factcheck', 'note:', '“the', 'tsunami', 'untruth', 'loom', 'larger', 'larger.”\n“th', 'notion', 'trump', 'exceed', '20,000', 'claim', 'finish', 'term', 'appear', 'ludicr', 'fact', 'checker', 'start', 'project,”', 'wrote', 'glenn', 'kessler,', 'editor', 'chief', 'writer,', 'factcheck', 'salvador', 'rizzo', 'meg', 'kelly.\nov', '14', 'months,', 'event', 'unfold', 'mueller', 'report,', 'trump’', 'impeachment,', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'polic', 'kill', 'georg', 'floyd,', 'trump', 'averag', '23', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'day.\nth', 'column', 'note', 'trump', 'express', '1,200', 'lie', 'mislead', 'claim', 'pandemic,', 'revolv', 'america’', 'test', 'capacity.', 'trump', 'us', 'record', 'testing.', 'expert', 'test', 'par', 'size', 'outbreak.\nth', 'post’', 'fact', 'checker', 'staff', 'trump’', 'prolif', 'lie', 'claim', 'us', 'economi', 'been.\npolit', 'scientist', 'agre', 'strong', 'economi', 'factor', 'seek', 're-election.', 'the', 'claim', 'economi', 'june', '2018', 'and,', 'post', 'wrote,', '“it', 'favorites”.\nbut', 'trump', '“been', 'forc', 'adapt', '[the', 'message]', 'tough', 'econom', 'times,', 'fantastic.', 'wherea', 'economi', 'us', 'history,', 'recal', 'achiev', '‘the', 'economi', 'histori', 'world’.”']",2395,400,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034567901,0.411111111,17,626,54.691,11th Grade,11.71

Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century.
Insight into the pressure that was heaped upon Fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, comes from thousands of pages of his communication records obtained by the Washington Post and the BuzzFeed news site, separately, and published on Tuesday.
The emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in the White House coronavirus taskforce serving Trump as the Republican US president.
As Fauci, kept on as a leading Covid adviser to Joe Biden, recently told the Post: “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop.
“I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.”
Among the emails obtained by the Post is one in which he speaks of the “crazy people in this world”, whom Fauci appeared to blame for politicizing the crisis, and who ultimately led to him receiving a full-time security team amid threats from extremist critics.
Others detail his wrangling with White House officials, including an exchange with Marc Short, an aide for the then vice-president, Mike Pence. The context is unclear, but according to the heavily redacted email Short wrote: “You correctly noticed the symptoms but misdiagnosed the root cause.”
“Thanks for the note. Understood,” is Fauci’s reply.
Others show correspondence with counterparts in other countries, such as a reply to George Gao, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention. Gao appeared to be seeking Fauci’s forgiveness for the words “big mistake” that were attributed to him in relation to his American counterpart in an article early on in the crisis about the US not advising the public to wear masks.
“That was [a] journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao wrote.
“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.
US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan , came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and “escaped”.
Among the most revealing emails are those from wealthy or influential correspondents. In one dated 3 April last year, Fauci refers to a conversation with the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, about a “collaborative and hopefully synergistic approach to Covid-19” with Gates’s charitable foundation.
Gates’s foundation director, Emilio Emini, says he is “seriously worried” about the health of Fauci, then 79, given his busy schedule. Fauci thanks Emini for his concern and says: “I will try to engage as much as I can given my current circumstances.”
There are also email exchanges with the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, about the creation of a coronavirus information hub on social media, and one with the actor Morgan Freeman who offers to get Covid-19 messaging out to his 100,000 Twitter followers.
Almost every email from Fauci is unfailingly polite and ends with a simple sign-off: “Tony”. And hidden amid the stacks of weighty correspondence are brief moments of humor, such as a 7 April 2020, exchange with an unidentified recipient, forwarding a link to an online news article headlined: “Cuomo Crush and ‘Fauci Fever – Sexualization of These Men Is a Real Thing on the Internet.”
“It will blow your mind,” Fauci writes. “Our society is really totally nuts.”","['as', 'anthoni', 'fauci,', 'us’', 'lead', 'infecti', 'diseas', 'official,', 'grappl', 'stage', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'spring,', 'pull', 'directions.\ndonald', 'trump’', 'white', 'house,', 'downplay', 'dangers,', 'demand', 'portray', 'outbreak', 'terms;', 'media', 'hungri', 'answers;', 'fauci’', 'email', 'inbox', 'constantli', 'officials,', 'public', 'celebr', 'offer', 'advic', 'seek', 'world’', 'deadliest', 'health', 'crisi', 'century.\ninsight', 'pressur', 'heap', 'fauci,', 'head', 'institut', 'allergi', 'infecti', 'diseases,', 'thousand', 'commun', 'record', 'washington', 'post', 'buzzfe', 'news', 'site,', 'separately,', 'publish', 'tuesday.\nth', 'email', 'offer', 'window', 'chaos,', 'panic', 'confus', 'time,', 'consider', 'difficulti', 'fauci', 'face', 'promin', 'figur', 'white', 'hous', 'coronaviru', 'taskforc', 'serv', 'trump', 'republican', 'us', 'president.\na', 'fauci,', 'lead', 'covid', 'advis', 'joe', 'biden,', 'post:', '“i', 'singl', 'question,', 'bit', 'confus', 'mix', 'messag', 'come', 'white', 'hous', 'what’', 'real', 'scoop.\n“i', 'reput', 'i', 'respond', 'help,', 'take', 'time.', 'and', 'it’', 'consuming,', 'i', 'do.”\namong', 'email', 'post', 'speak', '“crazi', 'world”,', 'fauci', 'appear', 'blame', 'politic', 'crisis,', 'ultim', 'led', 'receiv', 'full-tim', 'secur', 'team', 'amid', 'threat', 'extremist', 'critics.\noth', 'detail', 'wrangl', 'white', 'hous', 'officials,', 'exchang', 'marc', 'short,', 'aid', 'vice-president,', 'mike', 'pence.', 'the', 'context', 'unclear,', 'heavili', 'redact', 'email', 'short', 'wrote:', '“you', 'correctli', 'notic', 'symptom', 'misdiagnos', 'root', 'cause.”\n“thank', 'note.', 'understood,”', 'fauci’', 'reply.\noth', 'correspond', 'counterpart', 'countries,', 'repli', 'georg', 'gao,', 'director', 'chines', 'center', 'diseas', 'control', 'prevention.', 'gao', 'appear', 'seek', 'fauci’', 'forgiv', '“big', 'mistake”', 'attribut', 'relat', 'american', 'counterpart', 'articl', 'crisi', 'us', 'advis', 'public', 'wear', 'masks.\n“that', '[a]', 'journalist’', 'wording.', 'hope', 'understand,”', 'gao', 'wrote.\n“i', 'understand', 'completely.', 'no', 'problem.', 'we', 'together,”', 'fauci', 'replied.\nus-china', 'tension', 'pandem', 'us', 'investig', 'virus,', 'discov', 'wuhan', ',', 'animals,', 'scientif', 'community’', 'posit', 'time,', 'truth', 'theori', 'viru', 'studi', 'laboratori', '“escaped”.\namong', 'reveal', 'email', 'wealthi', 'influenti', 'correspondents.', 'in', 'date', '3', 'april', 'year,', 'fauci', 'refer', 'convers', 'microsoft', 'founder,', 'bill', 'gates,', '“collabor', 'synergist', 'approach', 'covid-19”', 'gates’', 'charit', 'foundation.\ngates’', 'foundat', 'director,', 'emilio', 'emini,', '“serious', 'worried”', 'health', 'fauci,', '79,', 'busi', 'schedule.', 'fauci', 'emini', 'concern', 'says:', '“i', 'engag', 'i', 'current', 'circumstances.”\nther', 'email', 'exchang', 'facebook', 'founder,', 'mark', 'zuckerberg,', 'creation', 'coronaviru', 'hub', 'social', 'media,', 'actor', 'morgan', 'freeman', 'offer', 'covid-19', 'messag', '100,000', 'twitter', 'followers.\nalmost', 'email', 'fauci', 'unfailingli', 'polit', 'simpl', 'sign-off:', '“tony”.', 'and', 'hidden', 'amid', 'stack', 'weighti', 'correspond', 'moment', 'humor,', '7', 'april', '2020,', 'exchang', 'unidentifi', 'recipient,', 'forward', 'link', 'onlin', 'news', 'articl', 'headlined:', '“cuomo', 'crush', '‘fauci', 'fever', '–', 'sexual', 'these', 'men', 'is', 'real', 'thing', 'internet.”\n“it', 'blow', 'mind,”', 'fauci', 'writes.', '“our', 'societi', 'total', 'nuts.”']",4192,668,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014166667,0.249166667,29,1134,44.635,College Level,12.996

A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored, to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”.
During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”.
The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.”
The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.”
He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020.
Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago.
The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”.
The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise.
Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions.
Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia.
Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.”
It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Thursday.
Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.","['former', 'us', 'donald', 'trump', 'appear', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'question', 'lose', '2020', 'election.\na', 'dramat', '30-second', 'advert', 'morgan’', '–', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'featur', 'rupert', 'murdoch’', 'talktv', '–', 'call', 'present', '“dishonest”', '“a', 'fool”.\ndur', 'interview,', 'trump,', '75,', 'appear', 'agit', 'morgan', 'tell', '2020', 'elect', '“free', 'fair”', '“you', 'lost”.\nth', 'responds:', '“onli', 'fool', 'that”.', 'morgan', 'trump', 'fool,', 'replies:', '“i', 'now,', 'yeah.”\nth', '45th', 'appear', 'defens', 'preview,', 'tell', 'morgan:', '“i', 'i’m', 'honest', 'man,', 'honest', 'you,', 'actually.”\nh', 'present', '“i', 'don’t', 'you’r', 'real”', 'morgan', 'fail', 'produc', '“hard', 'evidence”', 'support', 'unfound', 'disprov', 'claim', 'widespread', 'elector', 'fraud', '2020.\ntrump', 'prepar', 'presid', 'lose', 'joe', 'biden', 'ago.\nth', 'advert,', 'promis', '“the', 'explos', 'interview', 'year”,', 'trump', 'appear', 'walk', 'morgan,', 'tell', 'camera', 'crew', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”.\nth', '75-minut', 'screen', 'monday', '8pm,', 'launch', 'murdoch’', 'televis', 'enterprise.\nalthough', 'news', 'uk', 'talktv', 'tradit', 'roll', 'news', 'channel', 'featur', 'entertainment,', 'documentari', 'sport', 'programming,', 'bedrock', 'output', 'current', 'affair', 'discussions.\nmorgan', 'reportedli', 'paid', '£50m', 'host', 'daili', 'talkshow,', 'stream', 'fox', 'nation', 'us', 'air', 'sky', 'news', 'australia.\nspeak', 'hire', 'morgan', 'september,', 'murdoch', 'said:', '“pier', 'broadcast', 'channel', 'afraid', 'hire.', 'pier', 'brilliant', 'presenter,', 'talent', 'journalist', 'think', 'feeling.”\nit', 'morgan', 'announc', 'return', 'itv', 'year,', 'guest', 'lorrain', 'thursday.\nlast', 'left', 'itv', 'breakfast', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'on-air', 'clash', 'weather', 'present', 'alex', 'beresford', 'duke', 'duchess', 'sussex’', 'interview', 'oprah', 'winfrey.']",2346,386,2,0.935979291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.352055061,0,0,0.168859649,0.474122807,16,608,53.125,11th Grade,12.076

A short clip released on Wednesday to promote talkTV, the new Rupert Murdoch-owned TV station, gave the impression that the former US president walked out of an interview with Morgan in anger at the tough line of questioning.
The Murdoch-owned Sun and New York Post tabloids ran front-page news stories on the supposed bust-up as part of a carefully planned global marketing strategy for Morgan’s new show, which launches on Monday.
On tomorrow's front page: Donald Trump stormed out of a world exclusive interview with Piers Morgan in a blazing row
https://t.co/UxFHVIgi5O pic.twitter.com/Fs9CYYaCcs — The Sun (@TheSun) April 20, 2022
Trump’s team claimed the clip was misleadingly edited to give the impression Trump shouted “turn the camera off” while rising from his chair in anger. Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggested that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was subsequently edited for dramatic effect.
Taylor Budowich, Trump’s spokesperson, said: “This is a pathetic attempt to use President Trump as a way to revive the career of a failed television host.”
The mutually dependent relationship between Trump and Morgan has produced multiple interviews over the years, often generating headlines that keep both in the public eye.
The premise of Morgan’s new national show is that the presenter will be a fearless individual who says the things that are now impossible to say on national television. Promotional interviews for Piers Morgan Uncensored, which will earn its host tens of millions of pounds over the course of his contract, have shown him repeatedly complain about “cancel culture” and compare “woke” policies to fascism. Morgan’s personal approach to marketing the programme involves picking fights on Twitter with liberal or leftwing critics in the hope of provoking a reaction.
One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years.
In a surreal twist that shows the extent to which politics and the media are becoming increasingly entwined, it appears the individual responsible for the dossier was the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. He hosts a rival evening show on the rightwing channel GB News and will be competing with Morgan’s show for many of the same viewers.
In a video posted to his YouTube channel, Farage recalled visiting Mar-a-Lago days before the interview took place and telling Trump that Morgan had “gone around boasting in the UK media” that he was his friend while also “stitching you up”.
Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited.
Morgan, who was once sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photos, said: “He says it’s a rigged election, and he now says I have a rigged promo. What I would say is watch the interview. It will all be there. We won’t be doing any duplicitous editing.
“The promo reflects exactly what happened. Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go. But when people see the interview they’ll see that we have nice exchanges. We always have done before. But simmering is this anger he was feeling about what was said to him before we started the interview.”
The presenter quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain last year after refusing to apologise over comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He has said he is not right wing “but a fairly frustrated liberal” who had been a victim of cancel culture.
In the end, the self-described “narcissistically self-promotional” Morgan told the Lorraine show he was delighted with Trump’s furious reaction to the interview, due to the publicity it was creating: “I said to my team, the only way this can get bigger is if I wake up in the morning to a personal statement from Donald J Trump. [At] 5 am my phone rattled, and there it was!”","['donald', 'trump', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan,', 'claim', 'british', 'televis', 'present', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'video', 'meet', 'creat', 'buzz', 'show.\na', 'short', 'clip', 'releas', 'wednesday', 'promot', 'talktv,', 'rupert', 'murdoch-own', 'tv', 'station,', 'impress', 'us', 'walk', 'interview', 'morgan', 'anger', 'tough', 'questioning.\nth', 'murdoch-own', 'sun', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'tabloid', 'front-pag', 'news', 'stori', 'suppos', 'bust-up', 'care', 'plan', 'global', 'market', 'strategi', 'morgan’', 'show,', 'launch', 'monday.\non', ""tomorrow'"", 'front', 'page:', 'donald', 'trump', 'storm', 'exclus', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'blaze', 'row\nhttps://t.co/uxfhvigi5o', 'pic.twitter.com/fs9cyyacc', '—', 'the', 'sun', '(@thesun)', 'april', '20,', '2022\ntrump’', 'team', 'claim', 'clip', 'misleadingli', 'edit', 'impress', 'trump', 'shout', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”', 'rise', 'chair', 'anger.', 'audio', 'provid', 'trump’', 'team', 'us', 'media', 'outlet', 'suggest', 'realiti', 'comment', 'pair', 'exchang', 'pleasantri', 'chat', 'subsequ', 'edit', 'dramat', 'effect.\ntaylor', 'budowich,', 'trump’', 'spokesperson,', 'said:', '“thi', 'pathet', 'attempt', 'presid', 'trump', 'reviv', 'career', 'fail', 'televis', 'host.”\nth', 'mutual', 'depend', 'relationship', 'trump', 'morgan', 'produc', 'multipl', 'interview', 'years,', 'gener', 'headlin', 'public', 'eye.\nth', 'premis', 'morgan’', 'present', 'fearless', 'individu', 'imposs', 'television.', 'promot', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'earn', 'host', 'ten', 'million', 'pound', 'contract,', 'repeatedli', 'complain', '“cancel', 'culture”', 'compar', '“woke”', 'polici', 'fascism.', 'morgan’', 'person', 'approach', 'market', 'programm', 'involv', 'pick', 'fight', 'twitter', 'liber', 'leftw', 'critic', 'hope', 'provok', 'reaction.\non', 'morgan’', 'interview', 'trump', 'plan,', 'unknown', 'individu', 'hand', 'dossier', 'critic', 'comment', 'morgan', 'us', 'years.\nin', 'surreal', 'twist', 'extent', 'polit', 'media', 'increasingli', 'entwined,', 'appear', 'individu', 'respons', 'dossier', 'ukip', 'leader', 'nigel', 'farage.', 'he', 'host', 'rival', 'even', 'rightw', 'channel', 'gb', 'news', 'compet', 'morgan’', 'viewers.\nin', 'video', 'post', 'youtub', 'channel,', 'farag', 'recal', 'visit', 'mar-a-lago', 'interview', 'tell', 'trump', 'morgan', '“gone', 'boast', 'uk', 'media”', 'friend', '“stitch', 'up”.\nspeak', 'itv’', 'lorrain', 'thursday', 'morning,', 'morgan', 'appear', 'delight', 'trump’', 'claim', 'advert', 'interview', 'decept', 'edited.\nmorgan,', 'sack', 'editor', 'daili', 'mirror', 'publish', 'fake', 'photos,', 'said:', '“he', 'it’', 'rig', 'election,', 'i', 'rig', 'promo.', 'what', 'i', 'watch', 'interview.', 'it', 'there.', 'we', 'won’t', 'duplicit', 'editing.\n“th', 'promo', 'reflect', 'happened.', 'donald', 'trump', 'angri', 'couldn’t', 'go.', 'but', 'interview', 'they’ll', 'nice', 'exchanges.', 'we', 'before.', 'but', 'simmer', 'anger', 'feel', 'start', 'interview.”\nth', 'present', 'quit', 'itv’', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'refus', 'apologis', 'comment', 'meghan,', 'duchess', 'sussex.', 'he', 'wing', '“but', 'fairli', 'frustrat', 'liberal”', 'victim', 'cancel', 'culture.\nin', 'end,', 'self-describ', '“narcissist', 'self-promotional”', 'morgan', 'lorrain', 'delight', 'trump’', 'furiou', 'reaction', 'interview,', 'public', 'creating:', '“i', 'team,', 'bigger', 'i', 'wake', 'morn', 'person', 'statement', 'donald', 'j', 'trump.', '[at]', '5', 'phone', 'rattled,', 'was!”']",4251,696,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.089887511,0.335055096,30,1129,50.563,11th Grade,12.21

Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily.
China is a major nuclear power.
“It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”.
“I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added.
The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster.
Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’
“I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.”
In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”.
Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”.

At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump.
Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story.
Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had.
“Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.”
“His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”","['as', 'president,', 'donald', 'trump', 'repeatedli', 'aid', 'china', 'manufactur', 'hurrican', 'send', 'damag', 'unit', 'states,', 'unnam', 'senior', 'offici', 'roll', 'stone', 'tuesday.\ntrump', 'reportedli', '“hurrican', 'gun”', 'constitut', 'war,', 'so,', 'us', 'retali', 'militarily.\nchina', 'major', 'nuclear', 'power.\n“it', 'stupid', 'words,”', 'sourc', 'magazine,', 'speaker', '“intim', 'familiar', 'sit', 'president’', 'inquiry”.\n“i', 'sens', 'joke', 'all,”', 'sourc', 'added.\nth', 'news', 'tail', 'defens', 'secretari', 'mark', 'esper’', 'claim,', 'book,', 'trump', 'hit', '“drug', 'labs”', 'mexico', 'missil', 'deni', 'responsibility,', 'hair-rais', 'account', 'foreign', 'polici', 'disaster.\nrol', 'stone', 'quot', 'offici', 'saying:', '“i', '[once]', 'china', '‘made’', 'hurrican', 'send', 'us.', '[trump]', 'technolog', 'existed.', 'one', 'guy', 'responded,', '‘not', 'knowledge,', 'sir.’\n“i', 'i', 'offic', '…', 'i', '[then-]presid', 'heard', '…', 'he', 'time,', 'before,', 'nuke', 'hurricanes.”\nin', 'august', '2019,', 'websit', 'axio', 'report', 'brief', 'hurricanes,', 'trump', 'top', 'officials:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\ntrump', 'reportedli', 'aid', '“look', 'into”', 'notion', 'destroy', 'storm', 'nuclear', 'weapons,', '2016', 'nation', 'geograph', 'call', '“a', 'bad', 'idea”', '“a', 'surpris', 'history”.\ntrump', 'call', 'axio', 'stori', '“ridiculous”.', 'but', 'hurrican', 'rear', 'head', 'week,', '“sharpiegate”.\n0:48', 'donald', 'trump', 'display', 'hurrican', 'dorian', 'map', 'doctor', 'marker', 'pen', '–', 'video\nat', 'oval', 'offic', 'brief', 'hurrican', 'dorian,', 'trump', 'held', 'nation', 'hurrican', 'center', 'map', 'appear', 'alter', 'sharpi', 'pen,', 'hit', 'alabama', '–', 'baseless', 'claim', 'trump.\ntrump', 'comment', 'roll', 'stone', '“hurrican', 'gun”', 'story.\nstephani', 'grisham,', 'press', 'secretari', 'sharpieg', 'report', 'remark', '“nuking”', 'hurricanes,', 'magazin', 'hear', 'convers', 'china', 'hurricanes,', 'surpris', 'had.\n“stuff', 'unusu', 'him,”', 'grisham', 'said.', '“he', 'blurt', 'crazi', 'time,', 'aid', 'it.”\n“hi', 'staff', 'they’d', 'into,', 'know', 'not,', 'he’d', 'forget', '–', 'toddler.”']",2793,463,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.147531577,0.924604134,0.262872565,0.147531577,0,0,0,0.180205656,0,0,0,0,-0.118402778,0.429861111,23,748,54.956,11th Grade,10.833

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has struck western Mexico on the anniversary of two earlier devastating tremors, killing at least one person and causing flooding on the Pacific coast.
“It’s this date, there’s something about the 19th,” said Ernesto Lanzetta, a business owner in the Cuauhtémoc borough of the capital. “The 19th is a day to be feared.”
The quake hit at 1.05pm local time, striking near the town of La Placita de Morelos in the state of Michoacán at a depth of 15km.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued in Mexico City and the US tsunami warning system said there was risk of a tsunami near the coast, and footage posted on social media appeared to show flooding in the city of Manzanillo.
Was anyone killed? President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Twitter that the secretary of the navy told him one person was killed in the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, when a wall at a mall collapsed.
Did the quake cause a lot of damage? Michoacán authorities said there were no immediate reports of significant damage in that state beyond some cracks in buildings in the town of Coalcomán.
Judge orders release of Adnan Syed after more than two decades in prison

A Baltimore judge yesterday ordered the release of Adnan Syed after overturning his conviction for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee – a case chronicled in the hit podcast Serial.
Ruling that the state violated its legal obligation to share exculpatory evidence with Syed’s defense, the circuit court judge, Melissa Phinn, ordered Syed be placed on home detention with GPS monitoring. Phinn also gave the state 30 days to decide whether to seek a new trial or dismiss the case.
As the hearing ended, Phinn said: “All right Mr Syed, you’re free to join your family.”
Outside, Syed smiled as he was shepherded to an SUV, through a sea of cameras and cheering supporters.
What was wrong with the original trial? An assistant state attorney Becky Feldman described details that undermined the conviction including unreliable witness testimony and a potentially biased detective. Feldman said: “I understand how difficult this is, but we need to make sure we hold the correct person accountable.”
What have Lee’s family said? They haven’t responded yet, but in 2016 they said: “It remains hard to see so many run to defend someone who committed a horrible crime, who destroyed our family, who refuses to accept responsibility, when so few are willing to speak up for Hae.”
80s hits and nuclear secrets: security concerns plague Trump’s Mar-a-Lago
View image in fullscreen Thousands of sensitive documents lay nearby as Trump was spinning the Village People in Mar-a-Lago’s not so private club. Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP
At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the US turns DJ for the night, writes Julian Borger.
A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark.
“At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said.
What may have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies.
Why else is Trump in the news this week? Donald Trump made one of his highest-profile embraces to date of the extremist conspiracy group QAnon at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, making the apparently deliberate choice to play music that is virtually indistinguishable from the cult organization’s adopted anthem.

Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region , one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine was in “complete control”.
Britain may not strike a free trade deal with the US for years, Liz Truss has admitted ahead of her first bilateral meeting with Joe Biden. The new prime minister conceded that talks were unlikely to start in the “medium term” as she travelled to New York on her first foreign trip since entering Downing Street.
States are continuing to allow sewage sludge to be spread on cropland as fertilizer and in some cases increasing the amount spread , even as the PFAS-tainted substance has ruined farmers’ livelihoods, poisoned water supplies, contaminated food and put the public’s health at risk.
Republicans will try to impeach Joe Biden every week if they retake the house in November, a rare anti-Trump Republican congressman predicted. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said: “That’s going to look like child’s play in terms of what Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to demand of Kevin McCarthy.”
Stat of the day: rise in STDs, including 26% syphilis spike, sparks alarm

Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases, including a 26% rise in new syphilis infections reported last year, are prompting US health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts. Infection rates for some STDs, including gonorrhoea and syphilis, have been rising for years. Last year the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991 and the total number of cases hit its highest since 1948. HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the situation “out of control”.
Don’t miss this: librarians face unprecedented attacks amid rightwing book bans

If there’s one thing that Jason Kuhl has learned in the 23 years since he earned his degree in library sciences, it’s that the reality of being a librarian hardly squares with the storybook fantasy. “You tell people you’re a librarian and they think you spend your days reading and recommending books,” he said. From active shooter trainings to cancelled bookmobiles, librarians such as Kuhl are caught in the crossfire of a conservative censorship craze. For many librarians, the stress has become unbearable. Increasing numbers are complaining of sleepless nights and having to protect themselves from the deluge of harassment and humiliation tactics.
Climate check: ‘Africa is on the frontlines but not the front pages,’ says Vanessa Nakate

Vanessa Nakate knows what it’s like to be Black and overlooked. In January 2020, an Associated Press photographer cropped Nakate from a picture of youth climate activists, leaving her friend Greta Thunberg and three other white young women in the shot. It triggered widespread outrage, rightly so, but Nakate regards that very personal experience as a symbol of how the voices and experiences of Black – and Brown and Indigenous – communities are routinely erased. “Africa is on the frontlines of the climate crisis but it’s not on the front pages of the world’s newspapers,” says Nakate.
Last Thing: a pricey clothes rack? The people struggling to resell their Pelotons
View image in fullscreen ‘We brought it up two flights of stairs, which was the biggest workout that I got from it this whole time.’ Illustration: Marta Parszeniew/The Guardian
During the pandemic, Peloton became known as one of the small group of “winners” along with Netflix and Amazon. Over the last year, however, the enthusiasm has waned. The company reported $1.2bn in losses in the second quarter of 2022. The reason for Peloton’s flop era is obvious: once people could start exercising in gyms, the need for an expensive home exercise bike disappeared. Thousands of bikes now appear on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist, but are people able to recoup some of their initial investment? Or are they stuck with what has become the most expensive clothes rack in history?

On Wednesday the CEO of the Regional Airline Association, Faye Malarkey Black, told the US House transportation and infrastructure committee that over the next 15 years, nearly 50% of the commercial airline workforce will be forced to retire because they will reach the age of 65.
There are 70% more pilots between the ages of 43 and 64 than those between 21 and 42, Black said. “Reflective of the high cost of flight education and training, the ‘under 30 years of age’ cohort of pilots is the smallest at about 8% of total pilots,” she added.
As a result, 2,225 pilots must retire this year and required retirements will peak in 2029 at 3,750, when pilots who are now 58 will turn 65.
The Regional Airline Association represents regional carriers that offer feeder services to larger airlines which are facing their own set of pilot shortages. The shortages have driven larger carriers such as United, American and Delta to hire pilots from regional airlines.
According to Black, 12 large carriers have had to hire 13,128 pilots in 2022, sourcing “nearly all these pilots from regional airlines”.
The regional airline industry in turn is currently suffering from a “devastating pilot shortage” despite soaring passenger demand. The shortage, which has been growing for decades, has been largely driven by the “inability to create a sustainable pipeline of new pilots”, Black said.
One of the main challenges is the Federal Aviation Administration’s “inaction in advancing and evolving pilot training standards”, Black told the panel, adding that most pilots only have access to an hours-based pilot qualification standard which “incorporates little actual training after completing flight school”.
This has resulted in more pilot candidates failing out today than they did before qualification standards “favored flight time over quality training”, she said.
The loss of flights and declining pilots are bleakly reflected in medium- and large-sized airports across the country. Forty-two states for now have less air service than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Fourteen of those states have lost at least 20% of their service.
Meanwhile, over 500 regional aircraft are idly parked and the aircraft that have remained in service are currently underutilized, Black said.
Other factors contributing to the shortage of pilots include high training costs. Flight education and training at FAA-certificated pilot schools costs about $80,000, which can then increase to more than $200,000 when combined with additional expenses from a bachelor’s degree, Black said.
Because of the high costs, only the “most fortunate or affluent’’ pursue a piloting career in an industry that is already lacking in diversity: 95.7% of the profession identifies as white, according to the federal Census Bureau’s statistics on pilots.
One cost-efficient solution proposed by experts is providing simulators more widely, according to the aviation training company FlightSafety International.
“Allowing credit for simulator training for each rating on the ladder to becoming a professional pilot would make high-quality simulator experience an implicit part of the development of commercial pilots,” the CEO of FlightSafety International, Brad Thress, told the committee.
He added: “Increasing the maximum amount of credit for simulator training to a larger portion of a pilot’s flight experience would have a significant positive impact on the safety of our industry.”","['aviat', 'expert', 'warn', 'us', 'airlin', 'industri', 'hit', '“tsunami', 'pilot', 'retirements”', 'come', 'years,', 'fewer', 'travel', 'option', 'price', 'increases.\non', 'wednesday', 'ceo', 'region', 'airlin', 'association,', 'fay', 'malarkey', 'black,', 'us', 'hous', 'transport', 'infrastructur', 'committe', '15', 'years,', '50%', 'commerci', 'airlin', 'workforc', 'forc', 'retir', 'reach', 'age', '65.\nthere', '70%', 'pilot', 'age', '43', '64', '21', '42,', 'black', 'said.', '“reflect', 'cost', 'flight', 'educ', 'training,', '‘under', '30', 'age’', 'cohort', 'pilot', '8%', 'total', 'pilots,”', 'added.\na', 'result,', '2,225', 'pilot', 'retir', 'requir', 'retir', 'peak', '2029', '3,750,', 'pilot', '58', '65.\nthe', 'region', 'airlin', 'associ', 'repres', 'region', 'carrier', 'offer', 'feeder', 'servic', 'larger', 'airlin', 'face', 'set', 'pilot', 'shortages.', 'the', 'shortag', 'driven', 'larger', 'carrier', 'united,', 'american', 'delta', 'hire', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines.\naccord', 'black,', '12', 'carrier', 'hire', '13,128', 'pilot', '2022,', 'sourc', '“nearli', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines”.\nth', 'region', 'airlin', 'industri', 'suffer', '“devast', 'pilot', 'shortage”', 'soar', 'passeng', 'demand.', 'the', 'shortage,', 'grow', 'decades,', 'driven', '“inabl', 'creat', 'sustain', 'pipelin', 'pilots”,', 'black', 'said.\non', 'main', 'challeng', 'feder', 'aviat', 'administration’', '“inact', 'advanc', 'evolv', 'pilot', 'train', 'standards”,', 'black', 'panel,', 'ad', 'pilot', 'access', 'hours-bas', 'pilot', 'qualif', 'standard', '“incorpor', 'actual', 'train', 'complet', 'flight', 'school”.\nthi', 'pilot', 'candid', 'fail', 'qualif', 'standard', '“favor', 'flight', 'qualiti', 'training”,', 'said.\nth', 'loss', 'flight', 'declin', 'pilot', 'bleakli', 'reflect', 'medium-', 'large-s', 'airport', 'country.', 'forty-two', 'air', 'servic', 'covid-19', 'pandemic.', 'fourteen', 'lost', '20%', 'service.\nmeanwhile,', '500', 'region', 'aircraft', 'idli', 'park', 'aircraft', 'remain', 'servic', 'underutilized,', 'black', 'said.\noth', 'factor', 'contribut', 'shortag', 'pilot', 'train', 'costs.', 'flight', 'educ', 'train', 'faa-certif', 'pilot', 'school', 'cost', '$80,000,', 'increas', '$200,000', 'combin', 'addit', 'expens', 'bachelor’', 'degree,', 'black', 'said.\nbecaus', 'costs,', '“most', 'fortun', 'affluent’’', 'pursu', 'pilot', 'career', 'industri', 'lack', 'diversity:', '95.7%', 'profess', 'identifi', 'white,', 'feder', 'censu', 'bureau’', 'statist', 'pilots.\non', 'cost-effici', 'solut', 'propos', 'expert', 'provid', 'simul', 'widely,', 'aviat', 'train', 'compani', 'flightsafeti', 'international.\n“allow', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'rate', 'ladder', 'profession', 'pilot', 'high-qual', 'simul', 'experi', 'implicit', 'develop', 'commerci', 'pilots,”', 'ceo', 'flightsafeti', 'international,', 'brad', 'thress,', 'committee.\nh', 'added:', '“increas', 'maximum', 'amount', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'larger', 'portion', 'pilot’', 'flight', 'experi', 'posit', 'impact', 'safeti', 'industry.”']",3645,554,9,0.291888328,0,0,0,0,0.542515991,0,0,0.238964449,0,0,0,0,0,0.750582171,0,0,0,0,0,0.00625,0.361111111,22,984,35.53,College Level,14.797

In a report released earlier this week and cited by the New York Times, the navy revealed that a slew of problems including poorly organized medical structures, inadequate leadership and undetected drug use had plagued its elite Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal course, leaving many candidates injured and one dead.
Last February, 24-year-old Kyle Mullen died after contracting acute pneumonia following his completion of the course’s most rigorous portion, known as Hell Week.
The course has been described as a “crucible” event designed to expose candidates to extreme stress in a controlled environment, simulating what they might experience in combat. The event, the toughest training in the US military, includes harsh environments such as plunging repeatedly into freezing waters as well as simultaneous sleep and food deprivation.
According to the report, during a post-Hell Week meeting in February 2022 which Mullen attended, candidates were given a copy of a medical debrief that said: “DO NOT go and see other medical providers. We will see you at any time (if it is a true emergency call 911) … If you go and see other medical personnel who do not understand Hell Week they may admit you to the hospital or give you medicines that are not compatible with training.”
Following Mullen’s death, Rear Admiral Peter Garvin, the commander of Naval Education and Training Command, wrote in the report that medical support for trainees was “poorly organized, poorly integrated, and poorly led”.
Instructors deviated from the curriculum and instead adopted measures on “weeding out” candidates and “hunting the back of the pack”. Instructors did not allow rest and recovery in between intense periods of physical training and “continued conducting burnout or hours-long physical training to complete exhaustion, throughout the week preceding Hell Week when it had traditionally been tapered down to allow candidates to rest and heal minor injuries”, the report said.
The commander in charge of the course at the time, Capt Bradley Geary, primarily believed “the current generation had less mental toughness”, the report said.
As some students pulled out of the course, others resorted to illegal drugs to keep up.","['a', 'us', 'navi', 'investig', 'death', 'sailor', '“near', 'perfect', 'storm”', 'issu', 'elit', 'seal', 'train', 'system.\nin', 'report', 'releas', 'earlier', 'cite', 'new', 'york', 'times,', 'navi', 'reveal', 'slew', 'organ', 'medic', 'structures,', 'inadequ', 'leadership', 'undetect', 'drug', 'plagu', 'elit', 'basic', 'underwat', 'demolition/s', 'course,', 'leav', 'candid', 'injur', 'dead.\nlast', 'february,', '24-year-old', 'kyle', 'mullen', 'die', 'contract', 'acut', 'pneumonia', 'complet', 'course’', 'rigor', 'portion,', 'hell', 'week.\nth', '“crucible”', 'event', 'design', 'expos', 'candid', 'extrem', 'stress', 'control', 'environment,', 'simul', 'experi', 'combat.', 'the', 'event,', 'toughest', 'train', 'us', 'military,', 'includ', 'harsh', 'environ', 'plung', 'repeatedli', 'freez', 'water', 'simultan', 'sleep', 'food', 'deprivation.\naccord', 'report,', 'post-hel', 'week', 'meet', 'februari', '2022', 'mullen', 'attended,', 'candid', 'copi', 'medic', 'debrief', 'said:', '“do', 'not', 'medic', 'providers.', 'we', '(if', 'true', 'emerg', 'call', '911)', '…', 'if', 'medic', 'personnel', 'understand', 'hell', 'week', 'admit', 'hospit', 'medicin', 'compat', 'training.”\nfollow', 'mullen’', 'death,', 'rear', 'admir', 'peter', 'garvin,', 'command', 'naval', 'educ', 'train', 'command,', 'wrote', 'report', 'medic', 'support', 'traine', '“poorli', 'organized,', 'integrated,', 'led”.\ninstructor', 'deviat', 'curriculum', 'measur', '“weed', 'out”', 'candid', '“hunt', 'pack”.', 'instructor', 'rest', 'recoveri', 'intens', 'period', 'physic', 'train', '“continu', 'conduct', 'burnout', 'hours-long', 'physic', 'train', 'complet', 'exhaustion,', 'preced', 'hell', 'week', 'tradit', 'taper', 'candid', 'rest', 'heal', 'minor', 'injuries”,', 'report', 'said.\nth', 'command', 'charg', 'time,', 'capt', 'bradley', 'geary,', 'believ', '“the', 'current', 'gener', 'mental', 'toughness”,', 'report', 'said.\na', 'student', 'pull', 'course,', 'resort', 'illeg', 'drug', 'up.']",2368,368,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.218686869,0.510900673,12,654,28.793,College Graduate,17.09

According to US news website Axios, the president said in a meeting with top national security and homeland security officials about the threat of hurricanes: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
“They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can’t we do that?”
Quoting unnamed sources who were present at the meeting, Axios report that the response from one official was “We’ll look into this.”
On Sunday, the White House declined to comment on the Axios report. “We don’t comment on private discussions that the president may or may not have had with his national security team,” it said.
His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad Unnamed official
On Monday, from the G7 summit in France, Trump passed comment of his own.
“The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous,” he tweeted. “I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!”
Axios reported that Trump raised the same issue on another occasion with a senior administration official. This conversation was apparently recorded in a 2017 national security council memo which used the term “nuclear” in reference to the conversation.
Axios quoted a senior official who defended Trump’s ability to ask tough questions: “His goal – to keep a catastrophic hurricane from hitting the mainland – is not bad. His objective is not bad.”
Shortly after Trump came to power National Geographic published an article pointing out how frequently the idea of nuking hurricanes has been raised over the last few decades. “It’s an appealing thought,” it said, “especially when, during hurricane season, we’re annually reminded of the immense destruction wrought by these storms.

The paper’s Fact Checker column said Trump hit the milestone on 9 July, a day on which he delivered 62 such claims.
About half of them came in an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, among them a claim to have “tremendous support” in the African American community and the charge that Barack Obama and Joe Biden spied on Trump’s campaign in 2016.
The Post created its database during Trump’s first 100 days in office. Staff have since gone through every statement the president has made at press conferences and rallies, in TV appearances and on social media.
In those first 100 days, the Post’s factcheckers counted 492 false or misleading claims, at a rate of about five a day. Since then, the factcheckers note: “The tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger.”
“The notion that Trump would exceed 20,000 claims before he finished his term appeared ludicrous when the Fact Checker started this project,” wrote Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer, and factcheckers Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly.
Over the last 14 months, as events have unfolded around the Mueller report, Trump’s impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd, Trump has averaged 23 false or misleading claims a day.
The column notes Trump has expressed nearly 1,200 lies and misleading claims about the pandemic, many of which revolve around America’s testing capacity. Trump often says the US has the best record on testing. Experts say testing has not been on par with the size of its outbreak.
The Post’s Fact Checker staff found that Trump’s most prolific lie is his claim that the US economy is the best it has ever been.
Political scientists generally agree that a strong economy is the most important factor for a president seeking re-election. The president first made the claim that the economy is the best it has ever been in June 2018 and, the Post wrote, “it quickly became one of his favorites”.
But Trump has since “been forced to adapt [the message] for the tough economic times, and doing so has made it even more fantastic. Whereas he used to say it was the best economy in US history, he now often recalls that he achieved ‘the best economy in the history of the world’.”","['donald', 'trump', '20,000', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'office,', 'washington', 'post,', 'identifi', '“tsunami', 'untruths”', 'eman', 'oval', 'office.\nth', 'paper’', 'fact', 'checker', 'column', 'trump', 'hit', 'mileston', '9', 'july,', 'deliv', '62', 'claims.\nabout', 'half', 'interview', 'fox', 'news', 'host', 'sean', 'hannity,', 'claim', '“tremend', 'support”', 'african', 'american', 'commun', 'charg', 'barack', 'obama', 'joe', 'biden', 'spi', 'trump’', 'campaign', '2016.\nthe', 'post', 'creat', 'databas', 'trump’', '100', 'office.', 'staff', 'statement', 'press', 'confer', 'rallies,', 'tv', 'appear', 'social', 'media.\nin', '100', 'days,', 'post’', 'factcheck', 'count', '492', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claims,', 'rate', 'day.', 'sinc', 'then,', 'factcheck', 'note:', '“the', 'tsunami', 'untruth', 'loom', 'larger', 'larger.”\n“th', 'notion', 'trump', 'exceed', '20,000', 'claim', 'finish', 'term', 'appear', 'ludicr', 'fact', 'checker', 'start', 'project,”', 'wrote', 'glenn', 'kessler,', 'editor', 'chief', 'writer,', 'factcheck', 'salvador', 'rizzo', 'meg', 'kelly.\nov', '14', 'months,', 'event', 'unfold', 'mueller', 'report,', 'trump’', 'impeachment,', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'polic', 'kill', 'georg', 'floyd,', 'trump', 'averag', '23', 'fals', 'mislead', 'claim', 'day.\nth', 'column', 'note', 'trump', 'express', '1,200', 'lie', 'mislead', 'claim', 'pandemic,', 'revolv', 'america’', 'test', 'capacity.', 'trump', 'us', 'record', 'testing.', 'expert', 'test', 'par', 'size', 'outbreak.\nth', 'post’', 'fact', 'checker', 'staff', 'trump’', 'prolif', 'lie', 'claim', 'us', 'economi', 'been.\npolit', 'scientist', 'agre', 'strong', 'economi', 'factor', 'seek', 're-election.', 'the', 'claim', 'economi', 'june', '2018', 'and,', 'post', 'wrote,', '“it', 'favorites”.\nbut', 'trump', '“been', 'forc', 'adapt', '[the', 'message]', 'tough', 'econom', 'times,', 'fantastic.', 'wherea', 'economi', 'us', 'history,', 'recal', 'achiev', '‘the', 'economi', 'histori', 'world’.”']",2395,400,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034567901,0.411111111,17,626,54.691,11th Grade,11.71

Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century.
Insight into the pressure that was heaped upon Fauci, the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, comes from thousands of pages of his communication records obtained by the Washington Post and the BuzzFeed news site, separately, and published on Tuesday.
The emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in the White House coronavirus taskforce serving Trump as the Republican US president.
As Fauci, kept on as a leading Covid adviser to Joe Biden, recently told the Post: “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop.
“I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.”
Among the emails obtained by the Post is one in which he speaks of the “crazy people in this world”, whom Fauci appeared to blame for politicizing the crisis, and who ultimately led to him receiving a full-time security team amid threats from extremist critics.
Others detail his wrangling with White House officials, including an exchange with Marc Short, an aide for the then vice-president, Mike Pence. The context is unclear, but according to the heavily redacted email Short wrote: “You correctly noticed the symptoms but misdiagnosed the root cause.”
“Thanks for the note. Understood,” is Fauci’s reply.
Others show correspondence with counterparts in other countries, such as a reply to George Gao, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention. Gao appeared to be seeking Fauci’s forgiveness for the words “big mistake” that were attributed to him in relation to his American counterpart in an article early on in the crisis about the US not advising the public to wear masks.
“That was [a] journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao wrote.
“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.
US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan , came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and “escaped”.
Among the most revealing emails are those from wealthy or influential correspondents. In one dated 3 April last year, Fauci refers to a conversation with the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, about a “collaborative and hopefully synergistic approach to Covid-19” with Gates’s charitable foundation.
Gates’s foundation director, Emilio Emini, says he is “seriously worried” about the health of Fauci, then 79, given his busy schedule. Fauci thanks Emini for his concern and says: “I will try to engage as much as I can given my current circumstances.”
There are also email exchanges with the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, about the creation of a coronavirus information hub on social media, and one with the actor Morgan Freeman who offers to get Covid-19 messaging out to his 100,000 Twitter followers.
Almost every email from Fauci is unfailingly polite and ends with a simple sign-off: “Tony”. And hidden amid the stacks of weighty correspondence are brief moments of humor, such as a 7 April 2020, exchange with an unidentified recipient, forwarding a link to an online news article headlined: “Cuomo Crush and ‘Fauci Fever – Sexualization of These Men Is a Real Thing on the Internet.”
“It will blow your mind,” Fauci writes. “Our society is really totally nuts.”","['as', 'anthoni', 'fauci,', 'us’', 'lead', 'infecti', 'diseas', 'official,', 'grappl', 'stage', 'coronaviru', 'pandem', 'spring,', 'pull', 'directions.\ndonald', 'trump’', 'white', 'house,', 'downplay', 'dangers,', 'demand', 'portray', 'outbreak', 'terms;', 'media', 'hungri', 'answers;', 'fauci’', 'email', 'inbox', 'constantli', 'officials,', 'public', 'celebr', 'offer', 'advic', 'seek', 'world’', 'deadliest', 'health', 'crisi', 'century.\ninsight', 'pressur', 'heap', 'fauci,', 'head', 'institut', 'allergi', 'infecti', 'diseases,', 'thousand', 'commun', 'record', 'washington', 'post', 'buzzfe', 'news', 'site,', 'separately,', 'publish', 'tuesday.\nth', 'email', 'offer', 'window', 'chaos,', 'panic', 'confus', 'time,', 'consider', 'difficulti', 'fauci', 'face', 'promin', 'figur', 'white', 'hous', 'coronaviru', 'taskforc', 'serv', 'trump', 'republican', 'us', 'president.\na', 'fauci,', 'lead', 'covid', 'advis', 'joe', 'biden,', 'post:', '“i', 'singl', 'question,', 'bit', 'confus', 'mix', 'messag', 'come', 'white', 'hous', 'what’', 'real', 'scoop.\n“i', 'reput', 'i', 'respond', 'help,', 'take', 'time.', 'and', 'it’', 'consuming,', 'i', 'do.”\namong', 'email', 'post', 'speak', '“crazi', 'world”,', 'fauci', 'appear', 'blame', 'politic', 'crisis,', 'ultim', 'led', 'receiv', 'full-tim', 'secur', 'team', 'amid', 'threat', 'extremist', 'critics.\noth', 'detail', 'wrangl', 'white', 'hous', 'officials,', 'exchang', 'marc', 'short,', 'aid', 'vice-president,', 'mike', 'pence.', 'the', 'context', 'unclear,', 'heavili', 'redact', 'email', 'short', 'wrote:', '“you', 'correctli', 'notic', 'symptom', 'misdiagnos', 'root', 'cause.”\n“thank', 'note.', 'understood,”', 'fauci’', 'reply.\noth', 'correspond', 'counterpart', 'countries,', 'repli', 'georg', 'gao,', 'director', 'chines', 'center', 'diseas', 'control', 'prevention.', 'gao', 'appear', 'seek', 'fauci’', 'forgiv', '“big', 'mistake”', 'attribut', 'relat', 'american', 'counterpart', 'articl', 'crisi', 'us', 'advis', 'public', 'wear', 'masks.\n“that', '[a]', 'journalist’', 'wording.', 'hope', 'understand,”', 'gao', 'wrote.\n“i', 'understand', 'completely.', 'no', 'problem.', 'we', 'together,”', 'fauci', 'replied.\nus-china', 'tension', 'pandem', 'us', 'investig', 'virus,', 'discov', 'wuhan', ',', 'animals,', 'scientif', 'community’', 'posit', 'time,', 'truth', 'theori', 'viru', 'studi', 'laboratori', '“escaped”.\namong', 'reveal', 'email', 'wealthi', 'influenti', 'correspondents.', 'in', 'date', '3', 'april', 'year,', 'fauci', 'refer', 'convers', 'microsoft', 'founder,', 'bill', 'gates,', '“collabor', 'synergist', 'approach', 'covid-19”', 'gates’', 'charit', 'foundation.\ngates’', 'foundat', 'director,', 'emilio', 'emini,', '“serious', 'worried”', 'health', 'fauci,', '79,', 'busi', 'schedule.', 'fauci', 'emini', 'concern', 'says:', '“i', 'engag', 'i', 'current', 'circumstances.”\nther', 'email', 'exchang', 'facebook', 'founder,', 'mark', 'zuckerberg,', 'creation', 'coronaviru', 'hub', 'social', 'media,', 'actor', 'morgan', 'freeman', 'offer', 'covid-19', 'messag', '100,000', 'twitter', 'followers.\nalmost', 'email', 'fauci', 'unfailingli', 'polit', 'simpl', 'sign-off:', '“tony”.', 'and', 'hidden', 'amid', 'stack', 'weighti', 'correspond', 'moment', 'humor,', '7', 'april', '2020,', 'exchang', 'unidentifi', 'recipient,', 'forward', 'link', 'onlin', 'news', 'articl', 'headlined:', '“cuomo', 'crush', '‘fauci', 'fever', '–', 'sexual', 'these', 'men', 'is', 'real', 'thing', 'internet.”\n“it', 'blow', 'mind,”', 'fauci', 'writes.', '“our', 'societi', 'total', 'nuts.”']",4192,668,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014166667,0.249166667,29,1134,44.635,College Level,12.996

A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored, to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”.
During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”.
The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.”
The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.”
He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020.
Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago.
The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”.
The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise.
Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions.
Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia.
Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.”
It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Thursday.
Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.","['former', 'us', 'donald', 'trump', 'appear', 'interview', 'pier', 'morgan', 'question', 'lose', '2020', 'election.\na', 'dramat', '30-second', 'advert', 'morgan’', '–', 'pier', 'morgan', 'uncensored,', 'featur', 'rupert', 'murdoch’', 'talktv', '–', 'call', 'present', '“dishonest”', '“a', 'fool”.\ndur', 'interview,', 'trump,', '75,', 'appear', 'agit', 'morgan', 'tell', '2020', 'elect', '“free', 'fair”', '“you', 'lost”.\nth', 'responds:', '“onli', 'fool', 'that”.', 'morgan', 'trump', 'fool,', 'replies:', '“i', 'now,', 'yeah.”\nth', '45th', 'appear', 'defens', 'preview,', 'tell', 'morgan:', '“i', 'i’m', 'honest', 'man,', 'honest', 'you,', 'actually.”\nh', 'present', '“i', 'don’t', 'you’r', 'real”', 'morgan', 'fail', 'produc', '“hard', 'evidence”', 'support', 'unfound', 'disprov', 'claim', 'widespread', 'elector', 'fraud', '2020.\ntrump', 'prepar', 'presid', 'lose', 'joe', 'biden', 'ago.\nth', 'advert,', 'promis', '“the', 'explos', 'interview', 'year”,', 'trump', 'appear', 'walk', 'morgan,', 'tell', 'camera', 'crew', '“turn', 'camera', 'off”.\nth', '75-minut', 'screen', 'monday', '8pm,', 'launch', 'murdoch’', 'televis', 'enterprise.\nalthough', 'news', 'uk', 'talktv', 'tradit', 'roll', 'news', 'channel', 'featur', 'entertainment,', 'documentari', 'sport', 'programming,', 'bedrock', 'output', 'current', 'affair', 'discussions.\nmorgan', 'reportedli', 'paid', '£50m', 'host', 'daili', 'talkshow,', 'stream', 'fox', 'nation', 'us', 'air', 'sky', 'news', 'australia.\nspeak', 'hire', 'morgan', 'september,', 'murdoch', 'said:', '“pier', 'broadcast', 'channel', 'afraid', 'hire.', 'pier', 'brilliant', 'presenter,', 'talent', 'journalist', 'think', 'feeling.”\nit', 'morgan', 'announc', 'return', 'itv', 'year,', 'guest', 'lorrain', 'thursday.\nlast', 'left', 'itv', 'breakfast', 'good', 'morn', 'britain', 'on-air', 'clash', 'weather', 'present', 'alex', 'beresford', 'duke', 'duchess', 'sussex’', 'interview', 'oprah', 'winfrey.']",2346,386,2,0.935979291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.352055061,0,0,0.168859649,0.474122807,16,608,53.125,11th Grade,12.076

A short clip released on Wednesday to promote talkTV, the new Rupert Murdoch-owned TV station, gave the impression that the former US president walked out of an interview with Morgan in anger at the tough line of questioning.
The Murdoch-owned Sun and New York Post tabloids ran front-page news stories on the supposed bust-up as part of a carefully planned global marketing strategy for Morgan’s new show, which launches on Monday.
On tomorrow's front page: Donald Trump stormed out of a world exclusive interview with Piers Morgan in a blazing row
https://t.co/UxFHVIgi5O pic.twitter.com/Fs9CYYaCcs — The Sun (@TheSun) April 20, 2022
Trump’s team claimed the clip was misleadingly edited to give the impression Trump shouted “turn the camera off” while rising from his chair in anger. Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggested that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was subsequently edited for dramatic effect.
Taylor Budowich, Trump’s spokesperson, said: “This is a pathetic attempt to use President Trump as a way to revive the career of a failed television host.”
The mutually dependent relationship between Trump and Morgan has produced multiple interviews over the years, often generating headlines that keep both in the public eye.
The premise of Morgan’s new national show is that the presenter will be a fearless individual who says the things that are now impossible to say on national television. Promotional interviews for Piers Morgan Uncensored, which will earn its host tens of millions of pounds over the course of his contract, have shown him repeatedly complain about “cancel culture” and compare “woke” policies to fascism. Morgan’s personal approach to marketing the programme involves picking fights on Twitter with liberal or leftwing critics in the hope of provoking a reaction.
One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years.
In a surreal twist that shows the extent to which politics and the media are becoming increasingly entwined, it appears the individual responsible for the dossier was the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. He hosts a rival evening show on the rightwing channel GB News and will be competing with Morgan’s show for many of the same viewers.
In a video posted to his YouTube channel, Farage recalled visiting Mar-a-Lago days before the interview took place and telling Trump that Morgan had “gone around boasting in the UK media” that he was his friend while also “stitching you up”.
Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited.
Morgan, who was once sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photos, said: “He says it’s a rigged election, and he now says I have a rigged promo. What I would say is watch the interview. It will all be there. We won’t be doing any duplicitous editing.
“The promo reflects exactly what happened. Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go. But when people see the interview they’ll see that we have nice exchanges. We always have done before. But simmering is this anger he was feeling about what was said to him before we started the interview.”
The presenter quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain last year after refusing to apologise over comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He has said he is not right wing “but a fairly frustrated liberal” who had been a victim of cancel culture.
In the end, the self-described “narcissistically self-promotional” Morgan told the Lorraine show he was delighted with Trump’s furious reaction to the interview, due to the publicity it was creating: “I said to my team, the only way this can get bigger is if I wake up in the morning to a personal statement from Donald J Trump.

Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily.
China is a major nuclear power.
“It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”.
“I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added.
The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster.
Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’
“I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.”
In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?”
Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”.
Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”.

At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump.
Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story.
Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had.
“Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.”
“His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”","['as', 'president,', 'donald', 'trump', 'repeatedli', 'aid', 'china', 'manufactur', 'hurrican', 'send', 'damag', 'unit', 'states,', 'unnam', 'senior', 'offici', 'roll', 'stone', 'tuesday.\ntrump', 'reportedli', '“hurrican', 'gun”', 'constitut', 'war,', 'so,', 'us', 'retali', 'militarily.\nchina', 'major', 'nuclear', 'power.\n“it', 'stupid', 'words,”', 'sourc', 'magazine,', 'speaker', '“intim', 'familiar', 'sit', 'president’', 'inquiry”.\n“i', 'sens', 'joke', 'all,”', 'sourc', 'added.\nth', 'news', 'tail', 'defens', 'secretari', 'mark', 'esper’', 'claim,', 'book,', 'trump', 'hit', '“drug', 'labs”', 'mexico', 'missil', 'deni', 'responsibility,', 'hair-rais', 'account', 'foreign', 'polici', 'disaster.\nrol', 'stone', 'quot', 'offici', 'saying:', '“i', '[once]', 'china', '‘made’', 'hurrican', 'send', 'us.', '[trump]', 'technolog', 'existed.', 'one', 'guy', 'responded,', '‘not', 'knowledge,', 'sir.’\n“i', 'i', 'offic', '…', 'i', '[then-]presid', 'heard', '…', 'he', 'time,', 'before,', 'nuke', 'hurricanes.”\nin', 'august', '2019,', 'websit', 'axio', 'report', 'brief', 'hurricanes,', 'trump', 'top', 'officials:', '“i', 'it.', 'i', 'it.', 'whi', 'don’t', 'nuke', 'them?”\ntrump', 'reportedli', 'aid', '“look', 'into”', 'notion', 'destroy', 'storm', 'nuclear', 'weapons,', '2016', 'nation', 'geograph', 'call', '“a', 'bad', 'idea”', '“a', 'surpris', 'history”.\ntrump', 'call', 'axio', 'stori', '“ridiculous”.', 'but', 'hurrican', 'rear', 'head', 'week,', '“sharpiegate”.\n0:48', 'donald', 'trump', 'display', 'hurrican', 'dorian', 'map', 'doctor', 'marker', 'pen', '–', 'video\nat', 'oval', 'offic', 'brief', 'hurrican', 'dorian,', 'trump', 'held', 'nation', 'hurrican', 'center', 'map', 'appear', 'alter', 'sharpi', 'pen,', 'hit', 'alabama', '–', 'baseless', 'claim', 'trump.\ntrump', 'comment', 'roll', 'stone', '“hurrican', 'gun”', 'story.\nstephani', 'grisham,', 'press', 'secretari', 'sharpieg', 'report', 'remark', '“nuking”', 'hurricanes,', 'magazin', 'hear', 'convers', 'china', 'hurricanes,', 'surpris', 'had.\n“stuff', 'unusu', 'him,”', 'grisham', 'said.', '“he', 'blurt', 'crazi', 'time,', 'aid', 'it.”\n“hi', 'staff', 'they’d', 'into,', 'know', 'not,', 'he’d', 'forget', '–', 'toddler.”']",2793,463,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.147531577,0.924604134,0.262872565,0.147531577,0,0,0,0.180205656,0,0,0,0,-0.118402778,0.429861111,23,748,54.956,11th Grade,10.833

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has struck western Mexico on the anniversary of two earlier devastating tremors, killing at least one person and causing flooding on the Pacific coast.
“It’s this date, there’s something about the 19th,” said Ernesto Lanzetta, a business owner in the Cuauhtémoc borough of the capital. “The 19th is a day to be feared.”
The quake hit at 1.05pm local time, striking near the town of La Placita de Morelos in the state of Michoacán at a depth of 15km.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued in Mexico City and the US tsunami warning system said there was risk of a tsunami near the coast, and footage posted on social media appeared to show flooding in the city of Manzanillo.
Was anyone killed? President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Twitter that the secretary of the navy told him one person was killed in the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, when a wall at a mall collapsed.
Did the quake cause a lot of damage? Michoacán authorities said there were no immediate reports of significant damage in that state beyond some cracks in buildings in the town of Coalcomán.
Judge orders release of Adnan Syed after more than two decades in prison

A Baltimore judge yesterday ordered the release of Adnan Syed after overturning his conviction for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee – a case chronicled in the hit podcast Serial.
Ruling that the state violated its legal obligation to share exculpatory evidence with Syed’s defense, the circuit court judge, Melissa Phinn, ordered Syed be placed on home detention with GPS monitoring. Phinn also gave the state 30 days to decide whether to seek a new trial or dismiss the case.
As the hearing ended, Phinn said: “All right Mr Syed, you’re free to join your family.”
Outside, Syed smiled as he was shepherded to an SUV, through a sea of cameras and cheering supporters.
What was wrong with the original trial? An assistant state attorney Becky Feldman described details that undermined the conviction including unreliable witness testimony and a potentially biased detective. Feldman said: “I understand how difficult this is, but we need to make sure we hold the correct person accountable.”
What have Lee’s family said? They haven’t responded yet, but in 2016 they said: “It remains hard to see so many run to defend someone who committed a horrible crime, who destroyed our family, who refuses to accept responsibility, when so few are willing to speak up for Hae.”
80s hits and nuclear secrets: security concerns plague Trump’s Mar-a-Lago
View image in fullscreen Thousands of sensitive documents lay nearby as Trump was spinning the Village People in Mar-a-Lago’s not so private club. Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP
At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the US turns DJ for the night, writes Julian Borger.
A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark.
“At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said.
What may have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies.
Why else is Trump in the news this week? Donald Trump made one of his highest-profile embraces to date of the extremist conspiracy group QAnon at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, making the apparently deliberate choice to play music that is virtually indistinguishable from the cult organization’s adopted anthem.

Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region , one of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine was in “complete control”.
Britain may not strike a free trade deal with the US for years, Liz Truss has admitted ahead of her first bilateral meeting with Joe Biden. The new prime minister conceded that talks were unlikely to start in the “medium term” as she travelled to New York on her first foreign trip since entering Downing Street.
States are continuing to allow sewage sludge to be spread on cropland as fertilizer and in some cases increasing the amount spread , even as the PFAS-tainted substance has ruined farmers’ livelihoods, poisoned water supplies, contaminated food and put the public’s health at risk.
Republicans will try to impeach Joe Biden every week if they retake the house in November, a rare anti-Trump Republican congressman predicted. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said: “That’s going to look like child’s play in terms of what Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to demand of Kevin McCarthy.”
Stat of the day: rise in STDs, including 26% syphilis spike, sparks alarm

Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases, including a 26% rise in new syphilis infections reported last year, are prompting US health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts. Infection rates for some STDs, including gonorrhoea and syphilis, have been rising for years. Last year the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991 and the total number of cases hit its highest since 1948. HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year. David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the situation “out of control”.
Don’t miss this: librarians face unprecedented attacks amid rightwing book bans

If there’s one thing that Jason Kuhl has learned in the 23 years since he earned his degree in library sciences, it’s that the reality of being a librarian hardly squares with the storybook fantasy. “You tell people you’re a librarian and they think you spend your days reading and recommending books,” he said. From active shooter trainings to cancelled bookmobiles, librarians such as Kuhl are caught in the crossfire of a conservative censorship craze. For many librarians, the stress has become unbearable. Increasing numbers are complaining of sleepless nights and having to protect themselves from the deluge of harassment and humiliation tactics.
Climate check: ‘Africa is on the frontlines but not the front pages,’ says Vanessa Nakate

Vanessa Nakate knows what it’s like to be Black and overlooked. In January 2020, an Associated Press photographer cropped Nakate from a picture of youth climate activists, leaving her friend Greta Thunberg and three other white young women in the shot. It triggered widespread outrage, rightly so, but Nakate regards that very personal experience as a symbol of how the voices and experiences of Black – and Brown and Indigenous – communities are routinely erased. “Africa is on the frontlines of the climate crisis but it’s not on the front pages of the world’s newspapers,” says Nakate.
Last Thing: a pricey clothes rack? The people struggling to resell their Pelotons
View image in fullscreen ‘We brought it up two flights of stairs, which was the biggest workout that I got from it this whole time.’ Illustration: Marta Parszeniew/The Guardian
During the pandemic, Peloton became known as one of the small group of “winners” along with Netflix and Amazon. Over the last year, however, the enthusiasm has waned. The company reported $1.2bn in losses in the second quarter of 2022. The reason for Peloton’s flop era is obvious: once people could start exercising in gyms, the need for an expensive home exercise bike disappeared. Thousands of bikes now appear on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist, but are people able to recoup some of their initial investment? Or are they stuck with what has become the most expensive clothes rack in history?

On Wednesday the CEO of the Regional Airline Association, Faye Malarkey Black, told the US House transportation and infrastructure committee that over the next 15 years, nearly 50% of the commercial airline workforce will be forced to retire because they will reach the age of 65.
There are 70% more pilots between the ages of 43 and 64 than those between 21 and 42, Black said. “Reflective of the high cost of flight education and training, the ‘under 30 years of age’ cohort of pilots is the smallest at about 8% of total pilots,” she added.
As a result, 2,225 pilots must retire this year and required retirements will peak in 2029 at 3,750, when pilots who are now 58 will turn 65.
The Regional Airline Association represents regional carriers that offer feeder services to larger airlines which are facing their own set of pilot shortages. The shortages have driven larger carriers such as United, American and Delta to hire pilots from regional airlines.
According to Black, 12 large carriers have had to hire 13,128 pilots in 2022, sourcing “nearly all these pilots from regional airlines”.
The regional airline industry in turn is currently suffering from a “devastating pilot shortage” despite soaring passenger demand. The shortage, which has been growing for decades, has been largely driven by the “inability to create a sustainable pipeline of new pilots”, Black said.
One of the main challenges is the Federal Aviation Administration’s “inaction in advancing and evolving pilot training standards”, Black told the panel, adding that most pilots only have access to an hours-based pilot qualification standard which “incorporates little actual training after completing flight school”.
This has resulted in more pilot candidates failing out today than they did before qualification standards “favored flight time over quality training”, she said.
The loss of flights and declining pilots are bleakly reflected in medium- and large-sized airports across the country. Forty-two states for now have less air service than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Fourteen of those states have lost at least 20% of their service.
Meanwhile, over 500 regional aircraft are idly parked and the aircraft that have remained in service are currently underutilized, Black said.
Other factors contributing to the shortage of pilots include high training costs. Flight education and training at FAA-certificated pilot schools costs about $80,000, which can then increase to more than $200,000 when combined with additional expenses from a bachelor’s degree, Black said.
Because of the high costs, only the “most fortunate or affluent’’ pursue a piloting career in an industry that is already lacking in diversity: 95.7% of the profession identifies as white, according to the federal Census Bureau’s statistics on pilots.
One cost-efficient solution proposed by experts is providing simulators more widely, according to the aviation training company FlightSafety International.
“Allowing credit for simulator training for each rating on the ladder to becoming a professional pilot would make high-quality simulator experience an implicit part of the development of commercial pilots,” the CEO of FlightSafety International, Brad Thress, told the committee.
He added: “Increasing the maximum amount of credit for simulator training to a larger portion of a pilot’s flight experience would have a significant positive impact on the safety of our industry.”","['aviat', 'expert', 'warn', 'us', 'airlin', 'industri', 'hit', '“tsunami', 'pilot', 'retirements”', 'come', 'years,', 'fewer', 'travel', 'option', 'price', 'increases.\non', 'wednesday', 'ceo', 'region', 'airlin', 'association,', 'fay', 'malarkey', 'black,', 'us', 'hous', 'transport', 'infrastructur', 'committe', '15', 'years,', '50%', 'commerci', 'airlin', 'workforc', 'forc', 'retir', 'reach', 'age', '65.\nthere', '70%', 'pilot', 'age', '43', '64', '21', '42,', 'black', 'said.', '“reflect', 'cost', 'flight', 'educ', 'training,', '‘under', '30', 'age’', 'cohort', 'pilot', '8%', 'total', 'pilots,”', 'added.\na', 'result,', '2,225', 'pilot', 'retir', 'requir', 'retir', 'peak', '2029', '3,750,', 'pilot', '58', '65.\nthe', 'region', 'airlin', 'associ', 'repres', 'region', 'carrier', 'offer', 'feeder', 'servic', 'larger', 'airlin', 'face', 'set', 'pilot', 'shortages.', 'the', 'shortag', 'driven', 'larger', 'carrier', 'united,', 'american', 'delta', 'hire', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines.\naccord', 'black,', '12', 'carrier', 'hire', '13,128', 'pilot', '2022,', 'sourc', '“nearli', 'pilot', 'region', 'airlines”.\nth', 'region', 'airlin', 'industri', 'suffer', '“devast', 'pilot', 'shortage”', 'soar', 'passeng', 'demand.', 'the', 'shortage,', 'grow', 'decades,', 'driven', '“inabl', 'creat', 'sustain', 'pipelin', 'pilots”,', 'black', 'said.\non', 'main', 'challeng', 'feder', 'aviat', 'administration’', '“inact', 'advanc', 'evolv', 'pilot', 'train', 'standards”,', 'black', 'panel,', 'ad', 'pilot', 'access', 'hours-bas', 'pilot', 'qualif', 'standard', '“incorpor', 'actual', 'train', 'complet', 'flight', 'school”.\nthi', 'pilot', 'candid', 'fail', 'qualif', 'standard', '“favor', 'flight', 'qualiti', 'training”,', 'said.\nth', 'loss', 'flight', 'declin', 'pilot', 'bleakli', 'reflect', 'medium-', 'large-s', 'airport', 'country.', 'forty-two', 'air', 'servic', 'covid-19', 'pandemic.', 'fourteen', 'lost', '20%', 'service.\nmeanwhile,', '500', 'region', 'aircraft', 'idli', 'park', 'aircraft', 'remain', 'servic', 'underutilized,', 'black', 'said.\noth', 'factor', 'contribut', 'shortag', 'pilot', 'train', 'costs.', 'flight', 'educ', 'train', 'faa-certif', 'pilot', 'school', 'cost', '$80,000,', 'increas', '$200,000', 'combin', 'addit', 'expens', 'bachelor’', 'degree,', 'black', 'said.\nbecaus', 'costs,', '“most', 'fortun', 'affluent’’', 'pursu', 'pilot', 'career', 'industri', 'lack', 'diversity:', '95.7%', 'profess', 'identifi', 'white,', 'feder', 'censu', 'bureau’', 'statist', 'pilots.\non', 'cost-effici', 'solut', 'propos', 'expert', 'provid', 'simul', 'widely,', 'aviat', 'train', 'compani', 'flightsafeti', 'international.\n“allow', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'rate', 'ladder', 'profession', 'pilot', 'high-qual', 'simul', 'experi', 'implicit', 'develop', 'commerci', 'pilots,”', 'ceo', 'flightsafeti', 'international,', 'brad', 'thress,', 'committee.\nh', 'added:', '“increas', 'maximum', 'amount', 'credit', 'simul', 'train', 'larger', 'portion', 'pilot’', 'flight', 'experi', 'posit', 'impact', 'safeti', 'industry.”']",3645,554,9,0.291888328,0,0,0,0,0.542515991,0,0,0.238964449,0,0,0,0,0,0.750582171,0,0,0,0,0,0.00625,0.361111111,22,984,35.53,College Level,14.797

In a report released earlier this week and cited by the New York Times, the navy revealed that a slew of problems including poorly organized medical structures, inadequate leadership and undetected drug use had plagued its elite Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal course, leaving many candidates injured and one dead.
Last February, 24-year-old Kyle Mullen died after contracting acute pneumonia following his completion of the course’s most rigorous portion, known as Hell Week.
The course has been described as a “crucible” event designed to expose candidates to extreme stress in a controlled environment, simulating what they might experience in combat. The event, the toughest training in the US military, includes harsh environments such as plunging repeatedly into freezing waters as well as simultaneous sleep and food deprivation.
According to the report, during a post-Hell Week meeting in February 2022 which Mullen attended, candidates were given a copy of a medical debrief that said: “DO NOT go and see other medical providers. We will see you at any time (if it is a true emergency call 911) … If you go and see other medical personnel who do not understand Hell Week they may admit you to the hospital or give you medicines that are not compatible with training.”
Following Mullen’s death, Rear Admiral Peter Garvin, the commander of Naval Education and Training Command, wrote in the report that medical support for trainees was “poorly organized, poorly integrated, and poorly led”.
Instructors deviated from the curriculum and instead adopted measures on “weeding out” candidates and “hunting the back of the pack”. Instructors did not allow rest and recovery in between intense periods of physical training and “continued conducting burnout or hours-long physical training to complete exhaustion, throughout the week preceding Hell Week when it had traditionally been tapered down to allow candidates to rest and heal minor injuries”, the report said.
The commander in charge of the course at the time, Capt Bradley Geary, primarily believed “the current generation had less mental toughness”, the report said.
As some students pulled out of the course, others resorted to illegal drugs to keep up.","['a', 'us', 'navi', 'investig', 'death', 'sailor', '“near', 'perfect', 'storm”', 'issu', 'elit', 'seal', 'train', 'system.\nin', 'report', 'releas', 'earlier', 'cite', 'new', 'york', 'times,', 'navi', 'reveal', 'slew', 'organ', 'medic', 'structures,', 'inadequ', 'leadership', 'undetect', 'drug', 'plagu', 'elit', 'basic', 'underwat', 'demolition/s', 'course,', 'leav', 'candid', 'injur', 'dead.\nlast', 'february,', '24-year-old', 'kyle', 'mullen', 'die', 'contract', 'acut', 'pneumonia', 'complet', 'course’', 'rigor', 'portion,', 'hell', 'week.\nth', '“crucible”', 'event', 'design', 'expos', 'candid', 'extrem', 'stress', 'control', 'environment,', 'simul', 'experi', 'combat.', 'the', 'event,', 'toughest', 'train', 'us', 'military,', 'includ', 'harsh', 'environ', 'plung', 'repeatedli', 'freez', 'water', 'simultan', 'sleep', 'food', 'deprivation.\naccord', 'report,', 'post-hel', 'week', 'meet', 'februari', '2022', 'mullen', 'attended,', 'candid', 'copi', 'medic', 'debrief', 'said:', '“do', 'not', 'medic', 'providers.', 'we', '(if', 'true', 'emerg', 'call', '911)', '…', 'if', 'medic', 'personnel', 'understand', 'hell', 'week', 'admit', 'hospit', 'medicin', 'compat', 'training.”\nfollow', 'mullen’', 'death,', 'rear', 'admir', 'peter', 'garvin,', 'command', 'naval', 'educ', 'train', 'command,', 'wrote', 'report', 'medic', 'support', 'traine', '“poorli', 'organized,', 'integrated,', 'led”.\ninstructor', 'deviat', 'curriculum', 'measur', '“weed', 'out”', 'candid', '“hunt', 'pack”.', 'instructor', 'rest', 'recoveri', 'intens', 'period', 'physic', 'train', '“continu', 'conduct', 'burnout', 'hours-long', 'physic', 'train', 'complet', 'exhaustion,', 'preced', 'hell', 'week', 'tradit', 'taper', 'candid', 'rest', 'heal', 'minor', 'injuries”,', 'report', 'said.\nth', 'command', 'charg', 'time,', 'capt', 'bradley', 'geary,', 'believ', '“the', 'current', 'gener', 'mental', 'toughness”,', 'report', 'said.\na', 'student', 'pull', 'course,', 'resort', 'illeg', 'drug', 'up.']",2368,368,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.218686869,0.510900673,12,654,28.793,College Graduate,17.09
